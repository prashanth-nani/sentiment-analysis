Battery back up is excellent ,i am not a rough user so it stays all day long. Screen resolution is good for first time users,because  it is not good to expect like a 10,000rs smart phones. Browsing response is faster. Internal storage is very low its just 1gb...now its 50mb free in my phone now still response is quick,so u cannot use it without a memory card. This phone is good for normal users like using 3to 4hrs per day

255	Neeraj	Dec 22, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark 2 4 GB Black	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

On continuous use it will only last for 5hrs...  If you don't use ur phone still it reduces ur battery power....   U need to carry at all times a power bank....

You cannot load apps on the heavier side or those requiring major ram needs...but for a price as low as 4k and latest features...it's a very applicale fone in the market for consumers who would like to stay up to date yet within the low budget.   Thanks Snapdeal Team :)

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

1530	PrashantSubbu	Oct 07, 2015	Yes	Average Phone	This is my first android device. The product is superb for its price range. The delivery was very quick. The phone has some good features and its quite handy. The problems are 1 The battery life is too short 2  The menu key below are not that responsive 3   The contact display from the SIM gets unrecognised occasionally.
1531	Aman	Oct 04, 2015	Yes	Aman	Love this phone  very much . It feels very good when u hold it in your hand . The camera both rear and front are average. if u look at this fone from far then it looks like nokia xl . the fone is very slim and smooth however the speakers are not that good they are not too much loud . best phone in this price range . battery backup is also very nice . It heats up very little when u use it only for half an hour . Allover it is a lovely device and a hit for micromax!
