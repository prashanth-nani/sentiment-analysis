201	Charlie	Jan 28, 2016	Yes	Snapdeal gave me the BEST DEAL!	Awesome looking phone with amazing features. Although I had ordered a complete black colored phone for my wife, when we opened the package the color of the phone was not exact black. There was golden strip all around the edge, which my wife loved even more. So it was a pleasant surprise. (But I would suggest, stick to the exact piece you show online while placing order. Not everyone would like the surprise). There is no need for me to describe the features, it could be found anywhere online. I can just let know that all the features work perfectly fine and it is a perfect value for money phone. Moreover, Snapdeal has it cheapest anywhere online or offline. I would recommend both - the phone and the Snapdeal!

The memory is sufficient and the phone speed has not slowed down. All social media apps works very fine. The only drawback is the battery which drains out very quickly. Even if you don't use the phone whole day it drains out within 7-8 hours. It's a reasonably priced phone with all features of a high end phone.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

1377	good	Nov 05, 2015	Yes	Micromax canvas spark	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget , then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Sound through bundled headset is not that good, tried apps like Musixmatch - Lyrics & Music and get some decent sound quality.   Only drawback is the heating. Don't know whether these things are common in other android devices are not. The battery is fixed, so no option for battery change.  Overall I am 100% satisfied with my 5 month usage.

I showed it to service centre in Kalyan from where I had a very bad experience for service. After waiting for 2 hours, they told me I have to leave my phone there and it will take 25 days to repair the device.

Data speed is good. For playing games, this phone is good.

2130	sunilrathod16	Oct 17, 2015	Yes	Canvas spark vs. Karbonn s200 hd	First its display is not as good as karbonn s200 hd. Karbonn has hd display but spark has qhd. Lollipop on spark is good but it lags sometimes. One thing tht spark is better than karbonn is camera. Spark click better photos than s200 hd. Looking wise also spark beats s200 hd. Spark is slimmer than s200 hd. But karbonn last long than spark. Karbonn runs on KitKat thats why its runs smoothly than spark. Now decision is urs as micromax has better brand value, good camera and better looks.

2429	rohini	Oct 13, 2015	Yes	nice phone in this price	it is my son first mobile. having good price
2430	Sahil khan	Oct 13, 2015	Yes	Awesome Phone	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

2699	rkr	Oct 10, 2015	Yes	Better option	Micromax has kept skinning to an absolute minimum. The experience is essentially stock Android 5.0 Lollipop and it certainly helps with performance.Connectivity options on the Micromax Canvas Spark are bog standard. You get the usual 3G HSPA+, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS. The phone has Dual SIM support with 3G support on slot 1 and the second slot being relegated to 2G speeds. This is common for entry-level devices and not something we can really complain about. Of the 8GB of storage, there is about 3.6GB of free space available. You can bump that up via the microSD card slot. We tried out a 64GB card in the handset and it worked just fine despite the company’s claim of supporting up to 32GB of extra storage. The phone supports USB OTG as well and you can easily swap the default write disk between phone storage, SD card and the external USB storage.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands. This product is very very good choice in my LIFE. Thanks Snapdeal

3273	Mridul Pokhrel	Sep 30, 2015	Yes	Value for money, sleek slim and stylish device.	Canvas Spark is quite a good phone at its price with the latest features like Android Lollipop, Gorilla Glass, 8MP back and 2 MP front camera. It is light, slip and attractive.   However, as the brand managed to provide such features for 5k, the device gets leggy at times. The power button needs to be pressed very hard to start the device. It gets heated too much if you do some CPU consuming tasks. 1GB RAM is what dissapoints us.But how can we expect more than this at this price.  Overall its quite a good phone. The white one looks awesome.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

3819	venkat	Sep 24, 2015	Yes	The Best value for money.	Its a good phone in a budget, for regular usage of calls, messages, watsap etc.  But it is not for kids play and leisure on games etc.  Rear cam is good and the front one is not impressive. Some of the ringtones are very catchy.  Touch is so sensitive that if, it touches your cheek while talking, either the speaker gets on, or the call is kept in waiting.  As the speaker/mike quality is good, one can keep the phone a bit distant from the mouth.  No need to make a circus like hear with the ear and put at the mouth to talk.   Technically the phone is worth for its budget.  Go for it, as gives a good look and service.

3830	Pankaj	Sep 24, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	Awesome phone in this price range This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

4055	Bhupendra singh	Sep 21, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 8GB ROM Black	Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 8GB ROM  Realy osam This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this  masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.i love its,

4061	ajay jaiswal	Sep 21, 2015	Yes	Perfect mobaile	Micromax has pulled out  all the stops to create a premium-looking budget device; the Canvas Spark. We received a white/gold unit for review but it is also available in a grey/silver option. The matte rear curves gently, and coupled with the phone's 8.5mm thickness, makes this phone feel really good to hold. Moreover, the weight of 134g is distributed evenly across the entire body. The gold trim running around the edges is actually plastic but Micromax has given it a metallic coating to add some sheen. We saw a similar colour scheme in the Micromax Canvas Gold A300

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
4277	sameer chavan	Sep 20, 2015	Yes	Budget phone with some issues	I brought this on Snapdeal. They did not allow anyone to put reviews for subsequent sales too. So new buyers has no idea on the experience of the first buyers. Here some of the issues  1. There is NO move to SD card option. So all the apps are downloaded in phone memory. It has some 3gb available for users. But if you download games, it will eat up the memory. 2. There is NO option to reduce notification volume separately.  Both ringer and notification volume are connected and change at the same time.  3. There is NO option to set wallpaper for lock screen separately then home screen.  4. The so claimed gorilla glass is fake plastic acrylic. You can feel the touch when you tap the screen, it goes a bit inside like a plastic layer.  5. The screen is not touch responsive. You have to tap couple of times to invoke an app.  6. The software update is a custom micromax app that is provided by a spam Chinese company. It reads your activity and pushes apps download automatically. Even if you uninstall the preloaded apps, it will download it in background again  7. The phone is full of malware, adware and spyware, bundled by micromax.  I finally rooted the phone using kingroot and deleted all these malware. I had to also delete the software updater as it was constantly pushing ads. I know i will not be able to update this phone. But who updates micromax phones.  Now the phone is working good.

4419	ANIL	Sep 16, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

4511	Sawan	Sep 13, 2015	Yes	Micromax spark	my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from

No issues here. *All the three Buttons at the bottom are really useful and quite easy to operate and read a touch quite smoothly. * Great that it supports USB On The Go. You can connect your pen drive to it. * Gaming experience is ok * I am not a camera buff. So Camera for me is quite ok except maybe at night where dual LED flash needs to be improved. * With it selling like hot cakes, do you really have to care about negative reviews. Its only a phone and that too just 10 k bucks. You would rather regret buying it than regret after buying a 30-40 k phones.

ROM and RAM size is also good at this price. It enables you to use the apps easily making their use fun. It gives the look of an iphone, so you can easily show it off. Further owning this mobile would undoubtedly keep you engrossed in it and the in-built apps are really worth having. I would just suggest if you are looking for an android phone then don't miss this opportunity of possessing it as no other phone offers such good features as this offers.

Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 5k - 6k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

5424	sonu	Sep 04, 2015	Yes	best  phone ever	Performance and camera brilliant  We won't mince any words - we faced a lot of performance issues with the Canvas Spark. There were times when an app wouldn't open for a good 15 seconds after we had touched its icon. Also, sometimes the screen wouldn't be responsive after waking the device from standby. Thankfully, these issues didn't completely break the experience but the phone definitely did not feel smooth enough. High-end games struggled with constant stutters, but casual games worked fine. We must highlight the fact that all the Android One phones use the same SoC, but provide a better experience.  In the AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmark tests the phone scored 19,499 and 5,494 points respectively, which are in line with what we achieved with other phones with similar hardware. The Canvas Spark also scored 9.3fps and 3,231 in the GFXbench and 3DMark Ice Storm graphics tests.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Multitasking....I filled its memory with games and aap but it doesn't lag ,switching between the apps is pretty smooth. 3.camera....is average, 8mp doesn't seems like 8mp in picture quality. 4.battery......life is decent, in a single charge and the device can be operated a day and a half.  Conclusion.... At this price tag it is value for money you won't be disappointed.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

6154	alam anaari im   happy to shopping snpd	Aug 18, 2015	Yes	Micromax canvas spark	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

The battery as per my usage is average not bad a phone at this price. Phone feels premium but is really light weight. The front camera is good but the back camera gives average quality shots but acceptable from this sleek beauty. As far as the user experience is concerned, its near stock and smooth lollipop 5.0 build is nice. But beware, micromax has weird marketing strategy and constantly send spam notifications from system update setting. Overall very happy bought this phone.

Also support hotspot and WiFi direct with USB tethering. This is also the slimmest at this price making it an attractive handset There is no problem of freezing at moderate use. The surfing speed is good enough. Also you get 500 MB data for 2 months from Vodafone. So at this price segment your search stops at the spark.

Am fell bad to Chu's micromax mobile. This phone MICROMAX Q30 is waste of money. After 15 days of use the battery got swelled and the phone became totally defunct...Guys, This is a good phone with respect to specification and battery, I have been using this phone since last 3 weeks, and its response is phenomenal in this price. The battery is also lasts long. Use full discharge and full charge technique. Only draw back is front quick button light, which is absent.

6554	nataraj	Aug 01, 2015	Yes	micromax canvas spark	this is good smart phone  with 1 GB ram  i was very happy total the good product
6555	Awesome phone in this price range.	Aug 01, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my second android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is great, speaker is good, installed apps are of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands

Screen Size  The product is the best budget phone, but you will miss the following features in this phone which are available in Infocus phones 1.

6988	iqbal C M-cochin	Jul 22, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range-Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 8GB ROM-	Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp,Battery backup is excellent Cons: speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Micromax has equipped the Canvas Spark smartphone with a quad-core MT6582M chipset, running at clock speed of 1.3GHz, backed by 1GB of RAM. The handset comes with 8GB of internal storage and has microSD card support up to 32GB capacity.  The rear camera has 8MP resolution and is backed by LED flash, whereas the front camera has a 2MP sensor. The connectivity features are pretty standard: 2G, 3G, Wi-Fi, microUSB 2.0 and Bluetooth. The smartphone packs a 2,000mAh battery; it is 8.5mm thick and weighs 134grams, making it pretty compact despite the 4.7-inch screen. Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 5k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

7548	Worth for this money	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark - Good	Its just good. Nothing more to say. if you spend little more you can have Lenovo A6000+ or Mi4 for 8 K. I do not say its worst, spending little more you can grab 2GB RAM mobiles within 8K range. Android OS eats lot of RAM, so nowadays 1GB is treated as 512mb ram. Soon the Mobile gets Lag. So u can raise a question for what purpose u buy this then ? LOL. I dont buy this for me. One of my friend who adamantly love to pick it. So did it. :-)

7612	Faadu	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	One of the best android phone i ever seen	Making the much-loved Micromax Canvas Spark look overpriced, However, you wouldn’t guess that from first impressions. It’s dashing-looking, clad in a metal-mimicking plastic case that hardly convinces.  Everything else, fortunately, is brilliant. Its 4.7-inch, Full HD display is not only big, but sharp and accurate, offering excellent colour reproduction. Snap-happy consumers will also be happy with the 8-megapixel rear camera and 2-megapixel selfie sensor. We’re especially pleased to see that it runs an almost pure version of Android 5.0.2 Lollipop.   Performance is terrific too, thanks to the Corning gorilla glass 3 and 1GB of RAM.  Despite the size and quality of the display, its 2,000mAh battery will easily last a day, and possibly two with light use.
7613	DK	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Phone is worth to buy.	Phone is good in this range. only the camera quality is little bit bad. Speed of phone is also good and screen quality is good. Otherwise phone is good.

7617	Saurav	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Very Good Phone	I have used this phone for one week.

(Please let me know if some one founds this) 4) Notification toggle manual setting is missing. (Please let me know if some one founds this)

7760	KRISH	Jul 05, 2015	Yes	EXCELLENT PHONE	Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 8GB ROM Black - IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT PHONE TO THIS BUDGET. IT IS SUPPORTED TO OTG OPTION.
7761	QuantumDude	Jul 05, 2015	Yes	Great phone! Some flaws...	The phone is great for it's price! It's a nice phone with a big screen and good processor speed, there are no lags, amazingly responsive touch and nice display! And nice and convenient to carry around.        As for looks, it looks really premium. I recommend using white, if you're going for looks, white has an amazingly sleek matted finish at it's back. Black might look a bit dull but black phones always can go through more wear and tear. But if you buy a white, I recommend getting a cover to protect it's back if you don't want to spoil it.      But there are some features that are not satisfying, like the camera, it's not so good; and the resolution is not great either; also, it has 8GB internal memory, but only has 3-4GB free. Then the battery life, it's not very good. The speaker is not very loud... you have to switch on vibration too.       But don't go in it's flaws! You might not even find these flaws if you're not searching for them!       Overall, AMAZING and THRILLING phone for it's price! I recommend buying this phone other than any other expensive phone!

The touch options are bit fudgy and the screen display quality is not top notch but good. The Apps are pre loaded and few are very useful. Look is fine. The pre loaded sounds are good. The headphone is good with perfect fit to the ears. The battery backup is not yet checked as I have fully load features  and then decide the battery backup. The phone is sleek and trendy. The white is with golden border but I received the black one. I am satisfied with the phone. The data transfers are quite fast. It come along with the screen guard. They would have given an option of either the back cover or the flip cover along with the phone.  Anyhow it is  the best smartphone with the maximum features and latest software loaded. So.. I will go for one more time. Advance wishes for all the lucky fast fingers who are going to try on the next flash sale.. All the best.  Its worth..

8639	Karsam	Jul 01, 2015	Yes	"Quite impressive, would suggest to go for it!"	Actually I purchased this set for my friend since the highlight was so cool and the price affordable. And this is the best phone and stands perfect in it's price segment, even better than some branded sets in it's range.  The build quality and the design is the best part of this device and is easy to carry and use most of the time. Pictures taken from both front and the rare cameras are impressive. Touch response and colour production is very good and the device doesn't lags at all.  I only found it's downside in the audio section, the loudspeaker could be more louder and though the ear pieces looks good it doesn't give you the best. And last but not the least, the battery backup is not that good, but I think it is acceptable considering all the specs micromax has provided in this set.  Overall, it is a decent device to use, I would recommend to buyers who are seeking a good service in this range. Go for it...

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

9182	Pankaj	Jun 28, 2015	Yes	Don't think.. Just Go  for it..but be careful!	Micromax canvas sprax Q 380 is a good phone at a low price range. It has got impressive body and features. It's a good buy at this price. No regrets! But its battery doesn't impress at all. It dies so fast  For young people who use internet and play games for hours or so, the phone is  going to surely disappoint you.And also I forgot to mention that the audio jack of my set was faulty since the first time I used it. So it comes with some manufacturing defects, where it shows that quality has been compromised for the low price, for which I don't blame Micromax. If I comment on the OS, Android L is smooth and runs well, except sometime it doesn't respond, where I see there is a need of an update. Overall you are going to be satisfied with the phone.

9208	Pratyush	Jun 28, 2015	Yes	Best phone in the price segment	I have been using this phone for almost 2 months now and I must say, its been an excellent user experience so far.  All the specifications, and that too in this price bracket is just the best USP of the product. The camera works fine. All the apps for moderate to above moderate usage are supported very well without any lags. The added icing is the android lollipop which also gives a nice refreshed interface for the usage. The battery lasts a full day which is just fine given we have an option of powerbanks these days.  I am very satisfied with Micromax Canvas Spark and I will surely recommend others to go for it.

9213	Prem	Jun 28, 2015	Yes	Absolute Beast...At this Price range (under 7k)..	I bought it on 4 th flash sale..since from i using it for a week..no issues at all  Pros:    * Design looks very solid..(Actually I impressed with it's Design/ I didn't expect from Micro max)    * possessing Speed(1.2 GHz Processor) No lags at all    * Camera- Better Camera at this price range.u won't expect quality more than that for 5k.    * Display-Not a HD display but it is enough to view clear details(qHD).Touch is also great.    * Gorilla Glass-3(Adaption of Gorilla Glass for 5k is Great)    * OS-(First ever affordable smart phone that equipped with LOLLY POP 5.0)  CONS:    * Battery-It drains faster in heavy usage(Gaming and Continuous Surfing)(lasts only for 5-6 hours)..For moderate usage it lasts for one day    * Head Phone-Provided with this Phone is not Great...  MY OPINION    Over all the mobile is too great for this price range.Also am happy with the device.But battery back up is a concern. I will recommend this phone over Samsung or other brands that priced 10k..

I am using it & fully satisfied specially with look, sound quality, screen-picture-video resolution, camera 8/2 Mp is good, 1GB Ram with 8GB ROM is more sufficient for day to day user as always u have at least 600 Mb for multitasking & gaming where as my 6 months old Canvas Nitro A311 (2GB RAM) gives only 800 Mb for so.

SD is a window where you can get what you would imagine. SD has a very goid app with all things nitly placed. You can search anything very easily with all product details mentioned without any ambiguity. Also delivery service is proven to be unparalleled. So everytime whatever you wanna buy, search it on SD only. You will get everything at nominal price.

10036	Vab	Jun 25, 2015	Yes	Value for money - Go grab it	Nice phone in such price range.. One of those things that I didn't like was so many pre loaded apps but you can uninstall it anyway. Another drawback is non-removable battery.  But these two shortcomings are not that important. Important for me is value for money which this mobile provides.   One of those small features that I liked was to have a tiny led on charger and your mobile. So when you plug your charger and mobile you can see easily if it is charging.  Camera is of good quality, better than my Redmi mobile. 5 Inch size is perfect for me and it has a sturdy look.   Overall, I would recommend this mobile.. specially in this price range it is a grab. Also, it is very user-friendly, so if you want to gift it to your parents- go for it (as I did).

First pros:- System Ui and operating system were too good. Battery was good and best as it rated. Camera was brilliant and front cam also. Heating issues not much. Slim and attractive. Display was huge. And performance of this is phone was excellent.  Now comes to cons:-  Non removable battery. Video recording mode only in 3gp not mp4. Update to 5 inch of display its too better style of hand.  Lastlt what am saying is it was too good for beginners and as well as who want the best phone under budget here is the solution.. And its rockszzz  Thank you snapdeal for this best price deal. Really its dill ki deal.

The battery is also lasts long. Use full discharge and full charge technique. Only draw back is front quick button light, which is absent. Rest everything is fine.

10064	Kalpesh Mali	Jun 25, 2015	Yes	"I would buy this product again and again"	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 25k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands

I am not saying this is a space ship or this can wash all your clothes but surely it will keep your expectations up and make you happy.  Pros: The greatest advantage is price an value for money.  Running smooth with Android 5.0 lollipop.  Good back camera in daylight.  Big and HD like display  Cons: No detachable battery.  Lot of pre installed apps which is not useful.  Overall: An android device made in India. Could say the beat in market for the budget.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Very Good Phone at this price range.Touch is very smooth,there is no lag and display is very clear even outdoor in direct sunshine, sound is loud and clear , battery backup is average.

10842	Giri	Jun 22, 2015	Yes	Best phone in Rs. 5K -6K range	This phone is the best one in the given prize.I have been using for more than a week, and I am amazed by the features which it has. On top of this you get very beautiful android lolipop experience. Pros: 1. Amazing touch response.Screen resoulution is great. On top of it, gorilla glass gives added protection. 2. I am surprized with the picture quality taken from rare camera. Pictures are really beautiful. Front camera is also good. 3. Performance of Phone is good for moderate usage. There is no lag or heating for moderate usage. I didn't try to test any heavy games or apps. But I am happy with the performance it gave with moderate usage. Afterall it is a mid range phone, and it delivers what it promises. 4. Very lightweight. 5. Added support to wide variety of Indian languages. Mocromax has done good job of customising different system provided apps for different languages.   Cons:  1.Phone charger which came in the box , was not in working condition. I approched the micromax service center, and they immediately changed it. Micromax should check the qulity of the accessories before packing. 2. Battery provides backup for a day with moderate usage. 3. Headphones provided in the box are of cheap quality 4. Speaker is not that loud.  Overall, I am very much satisfied with the phone. If you want to buy a phone in 5K range, then this is it!

11685	Umesh Goyal	Jun 19, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Design is the one of the biggest positives of Micromax Canvas Spark. The brightness levels are pretty high, so it is pretty easy to read text and view images without missing out on details even under direct sunlight. Additionally, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 to protect it against scratches. The smartphone packs a 2,000mAh battery; it is 8.5mm thick and weighs 134grams, making it pretty compact despite the 4.7-inch screen. Micromax Canvas Spark is among the few smartphones to come with Android 5.0 (Lollipop).  One cant expect higher for a pocket friendly price than Lollipop, quad-core processor and 1 GB of RAM. Battery life of Canvas Spark, on the other hand, is pretty good. Another highlight is the network connectivity this phone offers. Micromax Canvas Spark is a decent smartphone for the price. The build, battery and network connectivity are counted in its strong suit. There are many small disadvantages of camera clarity but it deifnately makes a good buy for the small budget latest android phone.

Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is good, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands. By Jeevan Kumar from, pondicherry

Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands

Ihad to rush to the service centre to get it corrected.The biggest defect is its fixed battery.It is not removable.

According to my peraonal experience: PROS-  Touch is good, gorilla glass 3 (no need to use scratch guard and great clarity over screen), speed is good, graphics and screen is good, looks good, slim and light weight.  CONS- Sound of speaker is not loud, earphone provided is OK to use but could have been better, heating problem, lags while playing high end games.  OVERALL- To me I feel that I have got more than I paid. If you are looking for a phone around 6000 then go for it.

13293	snanda249	Jun 14, 2015	Yes	fantastic feautures on that price	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

13541	meeashu	Jun 13, 2015	Yes	good but not perfect.	This is a good phone at this price range. but 2 or 3 problems are there i.e.,  1. App drawer icon always disappears in every day so that you cant access the menu until you switch off or reboot the phone. solution - to Overcome this problem you have to install any launcher like dodol launcher, apus launcher etc. recommended dodol launcher. 2. In Micromax you cannot make memory card to default write disk even there is a option in lollipop for this. Only photo clicked by camera and Bluetooth files are writable in memory card. but in xender , uc browser it says memory card is not available. this is the very major problem because you have to always move your Whatsapp files, xender, uc browser files from phone memory to memory card for free some phone memory. solution - use shareIt it have option to change default write disk. only these two major problem are there otherwise every thing is better than just ok.  mobile never hang. camera is good. screen is perfect. battery backup is just ok.

Pros :- 1.feather touch         2. qhd display is just awesome.         3. battery backup is better than other phone under 10 k category.         4. camera quality is just perfect.         5. design of the phone is attractive and slim (you will surely love it).         6. Gorilla Glass protect ur phone from scratch.         7. And the best part is latest os lollipop....which provide interface just like iphone.  Now Cons :-           1.only thing i hate is micro sim support but u cant do anthing about it because all smartphones now support micro sim.  Just go for it....i dont know why the hell they release this phone in such a low price if u look at the specification than u think this price is toooooooo lowwww.

13754	dhaval	Jun 12, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

14113	Oju	Jun 11, 2015	Yes	What a phone...LoVinG iT :)	I was spellbound by the looks of this phone when i opened the box. It looks great because of its shining gorilla glass and elegant back panel.  Now pros 1. Premium design: looks really good and has a firm grip. Its quite slim actually and has a premium look.  2. Stunning camera: camera is absolutely an advantage of this phone. You just can not expect any better at this price.  3. Fast processor: 1.3 ghz mediatek does its job better than expected. There were no lags at all and asphalt 8 ran smoothly.  4: Sharp display: Display of the phone is nice to look at. It is vibrant and sharp. 1080p videos play well. Watching movies and playing games is what this phone is made for.  You get good qulaity earphones with the phone. Speaker of the phone it loud and clear.   And the cons  1: Battery is on a bit lower side. Although you get almost a day's juice  2. Display could have been a bit better with HD resolution but for this less price, its not bad.  3. Quality of usb cable and earphones cable is not so good. They don't seem much durable.  Cons are minor as compared to pros. This phone is worth every penny you spend. Don't give it a second thought just go for it.
14114	Mahesh	Jun 11, 2015	Yes	it worth spending money on it!!!	its my 1st android device, and it is up to my expectation. it hadn't let me down.  go for it ,its value for money

14357	chandan	Jun 10, 2015	Yes	"Don't final a smartphone by its price"	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this mobile. Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is good, very nice display. But battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, it would be better if the battery not inbuilt in the set. because if the set will hang then can't stop the phone till charge finish. tech spec shows internal memory is 8 GB but actually 5GB memory inside the device. Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a good smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high range smartphone like Samsung, Nokia or some others which offer similar features in high prices. If you are on minimal budget with high features then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

This mobile could give me a full satisfaction if some of these problem doesn't happened with me although its display resolution camera Quality is fantastic.If these problem doesn't happen with other Canvas Spark Mobile i will say, in this price range you can't find best mobile like this. I have suggest this mobile to my some of relatives and friends with this hope that These Some of problem will not occur with another product of this mobile.Some of them also registered for it in this week.

14603	pranab	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	less price ,good feature	Snapdeal is a good service website. I purchased my mobile on 13 may. After 7 days , I found some issue in Mobile. Then I talked with snap deal custom care. They said me to take it micromax service center. Then I went to service center, they were not ready to replace. Because my invoice date and mobile activation date was different. Then immediately I talked to Snapdeal custome care. They immediately was ready to replace where replace date was already overed.  I got one new mobile after 4 days. I checked and found the date issue,but that was android is issue. After some time that got fixed. Now I m extremely happy. Canvas spark is very good.both feature wise and performance wise is good. Antutu score is 200081 That is very good. If u compare with high quality mobile ,their antutu score is 22000.
14604	Jobettan	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	Super	Good one
14605	Raj	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	Nice And Stylish, with good performance and battery backup.	Love it
14606	Ganesh	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	Canvas Spark is the best feature-rich phone at this price.	Being a kind of "techie" person, when I saw all these great features at this price, I tried to acquire as much as possible tech info and reviews about this phone before placing the order. Then I got the phone delivered on 29th may and then used it continuously and observed all tech features very closely, then writing this review. I thought, use the product at least for 10-12 days, before writing anything pros or cons.  Pros.  Nicely Designed, Built Quality is also good, touch works Smoothly, GPS lock the positioning within a minute and camera is just fine if you take photos in sufficient light and keep your hand steady. Oh yes..! one thing I didn't know before, that it can record Super HD video at 1920x1088 pixel too, which is very rare. Many high budget phones doesn't have this feature. I don't play games but during doing multitask I didn't notice any hang or lags till now. I read, many negative comments about the battery. So here I would like to say, it may varies device to device and usage. Piece I got, it gives me 2 days battery backup without using internet. If i use internet with no downloads  (Browsing sites, checking emails 9-10 times a day) then it gives one & half day battery backup and I think its normal for android.  Cons. Photo taken in low light has much noise. Internet download speed is slow, on device and even on PC. When use as modem.  Still I say you can't find any other phone at this price, with all these features: 4.7" display, Gorrila glass, 8mp rear & 2mp front camera, Super HD 1920x1088 video recording etc. So just grab this Mobile, and feel proud on our Indian Product.

14667	Prince	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	Micromax has proved it , its not about a  brand name.	I bought this phone only trusting features specified for the product and i must say this one my best decision.At first i alson have some doubts about brand reliability etc.but this phone os best buy in this budget. Now some quick pros and cons Pros:Looks great,nice stylish look. Touch is smooth like other expensive phones u would not face any prob in touch. Camera quality is ok not so good not so bad. Sound quality is good. Phone runs smooth till not faced any hang problems Ram is suffcient almost 45-50% is in use most of the times. Though i dont play games on phone User interface is good,easy and  attarctive. Battery performane is ok i dont face any prob in battery normally limited to one day use only calling and internet no games. Cons:camera as i said above not upto expectation average quality. Speaker has low sound little bit prob is there.
14668	Wasim Kabir	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	Totally Awesome	Awesome device at this price range. It can even play Asphalt 8 without any kind of lag. I am very much satisfied with the device.  Though I am not satisfied with the courier partner (Gojavas). They do not update tracking details for almost 10 days. But packing quality is good.  Pros: A lot. So discussing this will be waste of time.  Cons: Only defect I found that the surrounding area of the rear camera is a metal, and I got shocked while charging the phone. But it will not be much of a problem, if you remember this "DON'T TOUCH THE REAR CAMERA WILE CHARGING".

Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.Manish K Adahv

15023	Abhinandan Bhattacharyya	Jun 08, 2015	Yes	Average, Ordinary	Let's get to pros and cons:  Pros: 1. Good screen 2. Decent size 3. Decent build (except the silver rim feels cheap plastic) 4. Android L 5.0  5. Multicolour led  Cons: 1. The touch response is not precise 2. Most pre-installed apps cannot be disabled. 3. Led notification lights are almost not visible 3. The device's sound lacks bass, so does the provided headphone, below average music experience. 4. The inbuilt 'Software Update' app for MMX's software update provider for the device is an ADWARE. It pushes notification about random apps to be installed. Cannot be disabled.  5. Apps cannot be transferred to SD.  6. Available inbuilt storage around 4 gb 7. Susceptible to lags.  Overall an OK phone. If you can increase your budget a bit, you should go for better options.

15324	Raghu Appu	Jun 07, 2015	Yes	nice	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands. By Raghu from,Karnataka

Pros: Nice look and display.Operations are quite fast. Touch works pretty well, preinstalled apps were useful too.  Cons: Too much heating problem. Playing games continuously for 10-15 minutes makes the upper half of the screen really hot you may fell it while playing. Sound system is also not up to my expectations.  Overall:I will not recommend this set if you love to play games. Otherwise it a really nice set one will not regret buying it. Truly speaking it's a masterpiece for such a low price.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

The performance and the configuration given at this price couldn't get any better than this. Worth the money. As the trend changes every week these days, this phone looks the perfect choice so that it can be changed in a year or so.  1GB RAM, 8GB memory (though 4GB is free), big screen Quad core are added advantages and does its work perfectly  Concern is it was delivered one day later than the expected delivery date.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

For this price range this one really unbelievable in terms of features as well as quality. Now my whole family is using this mobile and v r happy & satisfied. The delivery person from gojavaas was very rude and troubled us a lot on each and every delivery. That was a very bad experience with those gojaavas courier service fellows. Other than that the mobile is quite lovable. Great one.
16372	Briju	Jun 04, 2015	Yes	Best product	Best mobile phone ..............ummha.........
16373	Sourav	Jun 04, 2015	Yes	More Than Value For Money	I am writing this review after a week of usage.(I have been previously using both windows and android phones.)  Display size is quite large and most importantly I have not faced any lag while multitasking.  Connectivity is quite good, no issues with WiFi or 3G connectivity.   The Rear Camera is of top notch quality and I never expected it to be this good. Focus is very good and even gets macro mode quality images.  Front camera gets you good pictures in daylight otherwise quite unsatisfactory.  Touch quality is satisfactory.  The Battery drains out in a day considering usage of WiFi and listening music and accessing apps/games and it is non removable. Perhaps the only thing I'm not fully satisfied.  But the best thing was Snapdeal's service and delivery. Very prompt.  Considering the price and the features it is highly recommended from my side.

PROS 1,Processor is much responsive.  2,Picture quality of camera is good(Both rear as well as front).  3,Good quality of voice during call.  4,shape is very sleek.  5,Touch is very much sensitive. 6,Good connectivity of 3g(though only one card slot supports 3g)as well as hotspot and wifi.   One will miss few options which are present in high priced phones. CONS 1.)you can't edit menu.It remains as per installed applications. you just can't add page to place various apps as per your convenience. 2.) One CAN'T adjust differnt volume level for ringtone, messages, keypad, camera shutter. 3.) Sound quality of headset is not very good if you are to listen music but no problem during call.  4.) Preoaded with so many apps which many of people will find useless. Apart from above said few cons this phone is great. Previously i was using samsung 7582. But i'm much satisfied from this phone.

Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is good thing to this phone. battery backup is avrg. but taking a lot of time when charged. some apps not work error unformatly stop.

16981	faisal	Jun 02, 2015	Yes	i bought one also for my brother	Awesome phone, and very good service by snapdeal. What else do you want at this range, thus is the best budget smartphone Pros. 1. No lags this phone runs smoothy 2. Screen size is acceptable for a smartphone 3. Dont look at the mediatek quadcore processor it runs like a quallcomm snapdragon 4. An option for a cdma sim.....as the dual sim comprised one gsm and other cdma..but who uses a cdma sim in this gen 5. A big thumbs yp for camera this camera takes perfect photos in daylight but it gets slightly blurred in a full dark room. 6. Corning gorilla glass 3...you cant get a gorilla at this range on any other phone...super scratch resistent. Cons. 1. This gets heated up on continuous use but you can overcome this by installing apps like greenify, clean master which reduces the heat. 2 The autofocus feature of the camera is not so good it takes a bit more time to focus on the objects..sometimes it needs a manuel focus 3. I am nit so impressed by the UI of thus phone..and why not it is a micromax...the UI of samsung.moto.or lenovo is better than this and attractive 4. Non removable battery  Overall its a great phine at this range,...and beleive me you cant get better than this....thanx

Processor is good no lag and no performance issues. The touch is awesome. Internal memory is on the lower end 8GB.  Touch is responsive and the look of the device is quite good. The device is light weight and really good. The battery stays up until around 14- 18 hours on normal usage - facebook whatsapp, two sims and 3G data on for upto 4 hrs and WIFI on for the rest of the day. The pictures are ok. Front cam works fine. I beleive the default video player doesnt support all formats as I didnt have the audio playing just video for one of the videos sent by my friend (not sure of the format of the video though).

17140	raghav	Jun 02, 2015	Yes	awesome awesome phone everyone should buy it	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this.I If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brand.

17250	Anonymous	Jun 01, 2015	Yes	Best phone in 5k range	I purchased this phone recently from snapdeal.Below is detail *Very sleak looking phone,Phone is thin as compared to Redmi 2.Screen is similar to Redmi 2. *Back side plastic cover is fragile .When i opened phone to put sim ,i felt like it may break (luckily did not break) but quality of backside cover is not good. *Good thing is camera comes without camera shutter noise i.e. click sound while clicking photos are not there (you can enable sound in camera settings,if you want) *Phone comes with lot of unnecessary preloaded apps which consume lot of memory (MAd ,quicker etc etc )..I have disabled/uninstalled  these apps.So memory consumption is very low now. *Speed is fast (i read in one review phone is bit sluggish but i did not notice same in my phone,may be due to removal of unnecessary preloaded apps by me ,not sure) * Battery took almost 4-5 hours to become 100% when i charged first time but now more than 1.5 days are over still did not need to charge as of now. (note : i am not heavy phone user i.e. i am normal phone user i.e. i don't play games etc but i use phone for watsapp/fb/music/calls etc a lot.) *Only thing which i don't like about phone is "NOT removeable battery" ..battery is fixed with phone.So in case if mobile hangs so i guess i need to wait for battery to drain out (i am checking for alternative options on internet) ..Did not hangout as of now.  Overall: I think this is best phone in 5k range.

Every thing in the phone(according to its price) is at the peak like performance, camera, battery and the think I liked the most is the OS i.e Lollipop. Battery lasts easily for a day with the average usage. If u really want a genuine smartphone and can spend some more amount then buy Xiomi redmi note 3g really its a beast as compared to other fake produts in 9k range using it for last six months and it is giving me the same performance as it was giving before 6 months.

Prity good rare cancer with great picter   quality and file size of 3 to 4 MB each. 3. Decent front camera files like 5MP camera photo in proper lighting. 4.great phone security with in built app like Dr.safety & c clean 5.unlike other lollipop device this phone does not get heat easily on heavy usage. 6.decent battery life  Disadvantage 1.accessories like backcase for this new modal are hard to find so, bye the accessories online with the product.  Conclusion: Yes,you can by this mobile it worth more then it priced.Trust me guys after a long search for a budget phone I bought this one and it is something more then my expectations and fulfillment.

IN THIS PRICE RANGE, you will not get any device with feature of supporting pendrive..and it amazingly support external usb device...as it has 8gb internal memory and 1gb ram,you can afford lot of apps and you can play them togetherly but as it has 1.3 gigahartz quadcore processor phone will not go slow down...battery backup is good as it has 2000 mah and you can use it whole day and then put it for charging easily..the phn is lighter,slimmer and is quire handy,and good for carrying in the pocket...NOW MOST IMPORTANTLY CAMERA QUALITY FOR WHICH MOST OF THE MOBILE USER WAIT FOR... IT HAS 8 MEGAPIXEL CAMERA ALONG WITH 2 MEGAPIXEL FRONT CAMERA ..PICTURE QUALITY IS AWESOME...VIDEOCHATTING EXPERIENCE IN SKYPE IS ALSO GREAT...MANY OF THE APPS ARE DEFAULTLY INSTALLED.. It is dual microsim susupported and battery is mot replaceable and speaker is not too loud ...among all these good fearures i felt these 2 may be little bit inconvenient for the users OVERALL THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS PHONE iS BEST BY APPRECIATING ITS LOW COST AND ALL  THE AMAZING FEATURES WITH 1 yEAR WARANTY ..YOU CAN BUY THIS MICROMAX CANVAS SPARK PHONE GLADLY

Instinctively, I felt the 'CANVAS Spark' will be really good one and my guess has turned out to be true.  Nice touch, nice looks, user friendly and great resolution.  Probably one area that concerns me is that the instrument gets heated when being charged but the hotness vanishes after some time, very quickly after charging is fully done.  Wished to have the grey coloured instrument, but got white instead.  Overall though, quite happy and satisfied with the product.

18524	Ramesh	May 28, 2015	Yes	This is my first android device	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
18525	Raju	May 28, 2015	Yes	Priice worthy	Product is user friendly. Browsing is faster.  Display is good and pleasing. Comfirt in handling.  Sleek design(white). Only drawback is Battery.  Last for only 10 to 12 hrs for normal usage like e mailing and simple internet usage.   But if, for games battery won't hold for much time. Very much opt for everyone for this price. My experience is concerned, navigation(GPS) is very good and voice performance is very good while navigation.

The top edge of the tablet has got a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro usb 2.0 port is located on the lower edge of the phone. The screen lock button and the volume buttons lie on the right edge. It incorporates a 1.3 GHz quad-core processor with 1 GB of RAM. The inbuilt memory is of 8 GB which can be expanded up to 32 GB by a micro SD card. The powerhouse of the device is a 2000 mAh battery.  Operating System and Software Features  Canvas Spark runs on Android OS v5.0 (Lollipop) platform. The rivals of Canvas Spark, like Motorola Moto E 2nd gen, Lenovo A6000 are really worth comparing. The phone includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G, GPS and dual sim support.   Camera and Display  Canvas Spark sports an 8 MP auto focus primary camera and has an LED flash to accompany the elite lens. Daylight pictures are crisp and work very well on finer details. The 8 MP camera can capture 720p videos. The 2 MP front camera fulfils the purpose well enough and is really appreciable.  The 5 inch display of the phone has a resolution of 960x540 pixels and a capacitive touchscreen. The display possesses a pixel density of 234ppi and features Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection as well.  Overview  You can buy Micromax Canvas Spark online at the e-commerce store like Snapdeal. The processing speeds are good, and multitasking experience is a fine experience too. The device overall is one of the appreciable options in its price range.

18867	Nazim	May 27, 2015	Yes	Good budget phone in 5k	The specs provided are good and device is fluid and almost close to stock android experience. Battery backup is superb. Only thing is that it should be updated to Android 5.1 from 5.0 because at present 5.0 has lot bugs and 5.1 is more stable and even if 5.1 can't be made available at least it should get 5.0.2 which is yet better than 5.0. The camera performance was average but on using DSLR camera app, the pictures turned out to be better. Design and look is awesome and the phone feels premium. So a rating of 4 would be the best option and a 5 if future updates are made available.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you fr      as per my experince Compare to other provider like flipcart,ebay.ask me,etc snapdeal is one of the fastest delivery provider

19069	Sourabh Agrawal	May 26, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	I have received this phone on May 17 so my experience with this phone is about 10 days and overall the performance of this phone is nice. the picture quality of this phone is awesome because of the gorilla glasses woohoo.  Camra: The camra quality of rear cam is nice. Its 8 MP but it provides you picture quality clear but when you zoom in the cam the picture quality is reduced for sure but for the persons who are looking a smart cam so ofcource they can try this phone.  Battery:this phone have 2000 mAh battery with backup of 2 days on standby mode. and if you are using 2G internet it will last long till 15-20 hrs and remain 10% battery life. the performance should increase but in this budget phone this is the nice.  Calling Feature: On incoming call the screen will take on an average 1-2 Sec. to activate the display. means You will hear the ring and after waiting for 1-2 sec the display will allow you to pic/cancel the call. also if you want to call back to the missed call/ received call number the process is not good at all. you will see the Name/Number and when you touch the number then a small slide appear and you will the two options over there "Call Back" and "details" but the font of these links is Toooo small so not perfectly working with the touch. you might try 2-3 times and then you are able to call back. This is DEFINITELY the minus point in this phone. - sourabhagrawal.com

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

19645	Ujjwal	May 24, 2015	Yes	micromax canvas spark. . .nice smartphone and value for mone	I just bought this device, thst is my first android too, a week ago. I was looking for a budget smartphone. After i got my handset i was impressed with its light weight n slim design. In low light. Camera shoots average pic otherwise its good. Music play sound is not loud. But sound quality over the calls is fair. Display is not bright enough in sunlight.  Video playback experience was nice with hd movies. But mobile heats up during net surfing, games, video play.  a big problem with this mobile occurs when typing with its smartpad, suddenly it shows an error "unfortunately. reverie smartpad has stopped working" n hangs for few seconds. It has occured five times till now while m typing this review. Its very irritating. If u are fond of playing games then this is nod the right device for you. You will feel some lag after a racing game session of abt 20 mints. Pre installed apps r good. Touch works very nice. Battery lasts maximum for a day without using multimedia n much net. Overall nice phone at this price.
19646	BM	May 24, 2015	Yes	good	good ... keep it up...
19647	vijay	May 24, 2015	Yes	Powerreviews.com	Very nice and i like it

19649	Deb	May 24, 2015	Yes	More than Average Product	Good Staff, but playing games is not so good, good battery back up, camera is not so good as 8 mp
19650	Ankit	May 24, 2015	Yes	nice  phone	Great phone in this price tag
19651	Satyam	May 24, 2015	Yes	pretty good package for the given price	The mobile is pretty good considering its price. Pretty sleek and runs smoothly. Just one or two con's like low volume problem and moderate battery backup. I am a heavy gamer so while running any heavy game battery drains at more than in rmal speed but the games run smoothly I am playing shadow fight two and real racing 3 without any glitch or disturbances and image quality is also very good and quite clear images can also be taken from front camera.If you are looking for a budget phone, this is a good consideration for customers looking for a phone below 7 thousand, this is a very good choice.  At last I will surely recommend this phone as this review is being typed through this phone and I can definitely say this phone is a must buy budget phone for new users And it surely feels good to hold and looks great. The touch is nice and i am using this phone for a week continuosly and it gets better and better. Thanks Snapdeal for a fast delivery.

19658	Baljinder	May 24, 2015	Yes	Best Smartphone	This is the best android device for me and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp       Operating system Lollipop 5.0 is the latest feature in this device. Cons: Battery backup is very good, speakers are also good and loud, installed apps are of great use, quite thin. Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

19699	Tamal	May 24, 2015	Yes	Best Phone Under 5k	Have a chance to put my hand on the 2 most popular under 5k phones, The Huawei Honor Bee & Micromax Canvas Spark. & Guess what Micromax Canvas Spark is the Clear Winner.  These 2 Handset's almost share the same Feature. And Price is also Same.  Feature wise no complains.. It has a lot of good specs within a fixed budget of 5k.  Spark has a HD screen... Which is great.  Camera is also decent in this price range. You've to appreciate Micromax for that.  You'll get 4.5 to 5 GB free out of 8 GB & 600 MB Ram free out of 1GB. So your apps will go smoothly in this handset.  Looks very premium & very slim also.  But I don't like the built quality. it uses very thin plastic like back cover can break any time. & It's finger print magnet. You have to buy a back cover with it. otherwise the back cover will look 2 yrs old within 7 days of usages.

19718	Raghu	May 24, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark review	The Micromax Canvas Spark mobile phone is really good, it is more worth than the money we are spending to own the phone. Great quality, display and performance are really great. Only problem with the phone I see is that the camera glass backside of the phone is bulged out that will easily get scratches and this might create problem while taking pictures.

19723	Appu	May 24, 2015	Yes	if it available in gray it very good	Nice product value for money
19724	Vicky	May 24, 2015	Yes	Worth a buy	The delivery was quick. Likes:The phone is good. It has 240 ppi display density. The touch is smooth. Doesn't lag. Many of bloatwares can be uninstalled. Supports only micro sim cards. Wifi works as a charm. No connection breaks. Supports WPS push button, WPS pin entry, wifi direct and built-in screen casting (wireless display). Running foreground apps are shown on lock screen. Lock screen also suggests the time remaining for full battery charge. The rear camera is good in results and so is the front one. Rear camera is auto focus type whereas front camera is fixed focused. Pictures are grainy sometimes. The flash is effective in low lights scenes. Dislikes: The battery is non-removable Li-Polymer type which surely works better in respect of standby but screen time isn't that great. The speaker volume inaudible if you're in the crowd. The media playback volume isn't good either. The speaker lack a little woofing/bass. The earphones provided are in-ear type but the output is pathetic. The sound output is seems to be hitting the head. Nowhere close to Samsung but that's incomparable keeping in mind the price gap between MMX and Samsung. Worth a buy if you mostly use silent profile (like I prefer) or you have a Bluetooth headset. Been around 10 days but no heating problem noticed so far.

Good job in making this masterpiece. Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this.
19920	Prince	May 23, 2015	Yes	Cheapest handset today to run Android 5.0 Lollipop	The Micromax Canvas Spark is in many ways a very interesting device. For one, it is the cheapest handset today to run Android 5.0 Lollipop straight out-of-the-box. Secondly, it is also the cheapest handset today to come with a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protective cover on the front.The Canvas Spark is an ultra-budget smartphone, therefore obviously it has limitations.  That said we could have lived with some of these limitations, but as things stand today we have choices, and clearly better ones. You may argue, there are not many good handsets at Rs.4,999 which is right to some extent.  But we cannot totally wrap our minds around the Spark because of its inconsistent nature and heating woes. If you're a first timer looking to enter the world of Android, this one should make more sense for you especially since you're getting Lollipop out-of-the-box.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

20000	Angshuman	May 23, 2015	Yes	MICROMAX CANVAS SPERKQ380 8GB ROM WHITE MICROMAXCANVAS SPARK	MICROMAXCANVAS SPARK Q380 :-> Really Awesome Phone with latest facilities Thanks to Snapdeal for flash sale of this precious Aesthetic designed phone & also to hats off to MICROMAX Mobile Company. I am giving you some pros. & Cons. of this phone. Pros: 1. 4.7inch IPS qHD Screen with good touch, Android Lollipop 5.0[Latest OS] & HD Playback & Recoding, Aesthetic design,notifications on lock screen, Priority Mode: Get faster access by customizing app usage, pin Apps- Limit the access of apps for external users       2. 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, Mediatek MT6582M chipset, 1 GB DDR3 RAM, ARM Mali-400 GPU, 1,300MHz CPU Clock Speed, good fast Speed.      3. Primary Camera 8MP AF very good, vivid & clear picture, Face beauty mode in Front and Rear Camera, Largan Lens, OV Sensor 8858 very good. Front for 2MP for selfi is good, sound is good but not the best.       4. Battery 2000mAh is OK.      5. Display is good but not the best,      6. Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is very good for safety.  Cons: 1. 5 inch Super AMOLED Display will be better. Installed Apps are not good use. I would like to request MICROMAX through Snapdeal to make it Super AMOLED Display then it will be fabulous.       2. 1.3Ghz Quad core is good but 615 Snapdragon processor will be better( Personal Opinion).  1 GB DDR3 RAM [If it is 2GB RAM it will be far better],       3. Primary Camera is good & Front for 2MP for selfi is good but my personal opinion if it is 5MP it will be crystal clear. sound is good but not the best[ If it is Digital Dolby sound it will be very good.]       4. Battery 2000mAh is OK but 3000mAh to 4000mAh will be ideal for comfortable Smartphone use as energy dissipated quickly.       5. Phone is OK but Offers with this phone is not complied [ 2 months of 500MB free 3G data for Vodafone users, Applicable for subscribers not active on Internet packs. Use internet on Vodafone 3G/2G/EDGE as per the availability. Offer will be activated in 48 hours on first Vodafone SIM inserted in Micromax Spark Q380 till September 30th 2015.  I use it on 9th May 2015  when contacted Vodafone Care they informed Micromax will give me but till now on 23th May,2015 no message of offer came to me or given to me which is big unsatisfactory. For a popular company MICROMAX I don't expect it. Overall Phone is very Good.

20026	Ankit Bajpai	May 22, 2015	Yes	Best phone at this prise	This is my 4th android device. I think it is the best phone in this range. android 5.0 lollipop  has amazing inter-phase and working experience. It looks very slim and beautiful. Back camera is 8 MP which is very good and Front camera is 2 MP that is also good and capable to capture good selfies. 1 GB DDR3 RAM provide better performance speed. It has 8 GB internal storage and approx 5.5 GB user memory The good thing in its memory, that it is not divided in separate apps storage and user memory that means you can able to store a lot of apps in phone without devise lagging. Its 4.7 in IPS display protected by Scratch proof  gorilla glass 3. The feature in this phone that i most like, It support OTG cable that means you excess your pen drive in this phone like a tablet.      The weak point of this phone are- Battery is non-removable Battery backup is also not very good and it have some heating problem. Overall The Phone is good in their Segment and Prise and also capable to compare with Rs. 6000 to 8000 phone available in market.

20173	Ananth	May 22, 2015	Yes	Best mobile for the price	Best bang for the buck. Though I am not an intense or avid mobile user i feel this is the best phone one can get in this price that comes with a hella lotta features. Corning Gorilla glass 3 is awsm, camera quality is great but would have been better if pics can be clicked using volume buttons. Thats a drawback, and the volume of the speaker is quite decent. Fit and finish levels are great. battery life too, but drains if you use mobile data continously. Full night keep it on without wifi or data enabled just 1% drains and at times 0%..... standby time is awsm, voice calls are also great.   Haven't tried gaming to comment on performance....like i said I am not an intense user so I am more than happy and satisfied for the phone that I got fr this price point.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
20175	zameer	May 22, 2015	Yes	Value for money	Pros: Touch is good, nice looks, Light weight, fast and no lags, reasoanble display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use,  Overall: I am happy with the device for the money which is spent and I think it is a great budget smartphone and people should really consider while buying smartphone like Samsung, HTC, Moto or some others which offer similar features for high prices.

20539	dinkiedonk	May 21, 2015	Yes	You get what you pRay for	You get what you pay for *Battery is lousy. The Canvas scores much better over this one. Q380 has got a wrong name tag. Airbus is much fuel efficient whereas the Q380 sucks in terms of battery power. Take it that you would be spending an extra 2/- per day on charging this phone. *Unsure if its the screen guard or the screen itself but its kinda rough.  *You would expect it to be fast but I have my doubts on the processor. * I dug into the device on the development mode and you cannot control most of its features. *Cheap Plastic at the rear. Make sure your hands are abolsutely clean or you have some kind of CANVAS for your CANVAS. *Although applications are installed you can uninstall most of them and free up some space unlike others. *Camera is pretty good but video capabilities is worst. *Havent dropped it so dont know abt the Gorilla glass but I do not like the display at the edges. It sort of curves up.

20544	navjot	May 21, 2015	Yes	best exprience out of the box	q380 phone is more than good phone it contains 1.3 ghz quad core processor which does its work realy well as it not even lag after opening 10 background apps . one of the major advantage of this phone is that is budget phone and extremely stunning looks. at the same time its battery backup was not that much good. i recommend it to every new andriod user as if u purchase samsung and other big brand phones with similar features you will be charged around 10000 to 15000 also micromax is expanding very fastly with more service centres accros india. i liked small notification light near front camera and placement of volume , power key

20548	dchakra	May 21, 2015	Yes	An awesome device!!	Using the phone for the last 10 days and below are my feedback.  Pros: 1. Nice display with a big screen size and vibrant colour 2. Processor speed is good; no hang ups 3. Total usable space in Phone is 4.94GB which is sufficient to load a lot of Apps  Cons: 1. Front camera quality could have been better 2. Sound output can be improved  At the price, I bought the phone, I'm quite happy with it and can ignore the little limitations that it has. Its a real value for money! I'll suggest anyone who wants the best smartphone at below Rs.5,000, can blindly go for this one.

20650	darshan	May 21, 2015	Yes	awesome	Best for all types of products local nd company madeThe last few months of my life have been very exciting. I suddenly have a very happening nightlife. Every night, me and my wife finish up our chores, surround ourselves with bowls of snacks, connect the laptop with the TV and go shopping.  Online shopping is not a new idea in India. Times Shopping and Rediff Shopping have been offering this for a few years now. But it has become a practical idea now. Most of the shopping sites are funded today. They have the money, the set up and the understanding of the business. They are serious about their branding, quite a few spend crores on advertising and evoke the trust needed to shop on the basis of a few photographs.  Best of all, the sites are better. Almost all of them have thousands of products, pretty good photographs and easy to navigate modern websites. Check out one of the older ecommerce sites and this new one or this one and you can see why a stiff like me will so easily buy products that he can't touch.  Anyway, there is no need for me to educate you about the joys of online shopping. Now, let's get down in the trenches and get the hard work of comparing the sites done.

A person who is confusing about size, can chose 4.7 inch. also touch is very smooth. ohh... a Big Plus Point is its size Super thin and light weight.

20866	pulak gupta	May 21, 2015	Yes	disappointing... not up to the mark as expected	I bought this set by seeing the features in such a low price but after using the phone I am not so satisfied. Specially the sound quality and battery life is very discouraging when compared against asus zenfone 4 or other same priced set. But the corning gorilla glass and 8GB camera is worth to mention. Look is also good. As a whole this is not a wonder in low budget smartfone range.  But one thing I must mention is about delivery frop snapdeal... they really delivered it very fast and smoothly

Front camera is ok OS: Lollipop feels smooth on this phone and is undoubtedly the biggest USP  Audio : Speakers are decent but not great, you feel that the sound could have been louder. Display : for qHd display you expect the phone to show some color saturation and that is there. Though color reproduction is good. Overall a decent display Headphones : Worst headphones that I have seen. It would have been fine if they haven't provided them at all Recommendation : Canvas spark is value for money. If you can do with average performance and decent display, got for it.

21034	Vivek Kumar	May 20, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark- A Spark Certainly Best phone	The phone was too good, people have reported its heating issue but it is actually not there. You may found a heating issue if you run any heavy application on even on a high end phone heating issue you may found it there. Also due to a quad core processor the processing of this phone under this budget is superb. Its a high recommended phone from my end to  other users who will read this review. The only challenge is its unavailability and snapdeal on/off the sale as per the availability of this phone.  Camera quality is also good, front camera may be less in caparison but it is good enough to do a video chat over 3G.  Internal Storage in this budget phone is decent which is 8 gb . you can expect at least this much storage in the phone. which you can even expand upto 32 GB.  A highly recommended phone from side.
21035	ghanashyam	May 20, 2015	Yes	Review tip: Detailed reviews focused on product quality and	Micromax canvas spark is SO better  than others.

21050	Uday Seth	May 20, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	What an unbelievably amazing phone at a steal away price!!!   Pros:   1. Design and feel of the phone is just spectacular. U will feel like u r holding a 40K or above phone. 2. Great battery life. Used it for more than 30 hours and still 25% of juice was left. I am an aggressive phone user with more than 60 apps installed already . P.S. I am not even using greenify !!! 3. Nice decent camera with vibrant colors when clicked in sunlight. Even in dark the pictures were pretty brilliant but then i am not comparing with a Sony Z series phone. 4. Good sound quality. I would give 4/5 rating to speaker. The in ear speaker for call is loud enough even for someone who has hearing problems. 5. Running Lollipop at such a killing price PRICE !!!! Yes thats the biggest pro. There isnt any phone in the market for 5 grand with such decent specs. 6. Finally the Processor! its fast and you wont feel any lag while using the phone even for more than an hour continuously. P.S. I dont play heavy games but temple run 2 and subway surfer is running as good as it runs on a Nexus 5.  Cons:  The only minor drawback is the screen size. It could have been 5" exact but even 4.7" is decent enough.

21235	gujju nagakumar	May 20, 2015	Yes	BEST PHONE EVER	hey guyz . I bought this phone before 1 month. the phone is working perfect . 1.8m Back Camera is very good. . Front is ok great. the best thing about the camera is auto focus. Camera is heavily customised.  2.display is good. however viewing angles are too great but satisfactory. display is bright enough . you cant feel any problem even in sunlight. 3.sim card are working good,network strenght is also good.but one thing that i felt is bad we can not connect manually to 3G network .  Performance of the cpu is quite impressive. Antutu benchmark is best score which is realy surprising in this range. heads off to .3GHz Quad Core Cortex A7 Processor. 4.speaker Sound is very clear however too low . we can not hear anything in noisy environment . sound in headphone is very impressive . however u cant get any of the earphone within the box . you have to sort out some extra bucks for this. 5.The design of the phone is very good. good thing is capactive buttons are out of screen but bad thing is they are not BACKLED.back cover is good ,it has rubberised coating . feels very good in hand .power button and volume rockers are made of cheap plastic with metal finishing. 6.Gorrila glass looks good . it would get any of scratches hardly. 8. Call quality is pretty awesome and crystal clear. 9. Battery : one of the major problem with the phone is its battery. battery is of 2000 mAH which is not too bad . normally phone works for 6 to 7 hour in continuous usage of wifi and web browsing. but guyz today em gonna tell you how u can increase the battery life . first location services and auto syncing should be off. second smart saving function should be on in ultra saving mode . third u cant find in the phone . but i m telling how you do find in the phone . Go to setting>About>software information >build number. click on build number 5 times continously . now it will tell you that now you are a Developer. now open setting again and u will find the option of "developer option" at bottom side . open it and find "set background process" at bottom side ,open and "set it two or one." now done . it will increase your battery life from 4 hours to 8 hours. battery would not drain automatically even in stand by mode . Thank you all.

It's better buy this phone than other 10k phones, you'd be saving half the money getting almost same features. And also comes with android lollipop 5 you can't get anything better than this.
21607	sanju2301	May 19, 2015	Yes	perfect	perfect
21608	Sudip	May 19, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range.....	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

21615	Ranjeet Arora	May 19, 2015	Yes	Getting more satisfaction	Although your service is upto the mark, needless to say,and also giving better option to customer for returning/cancellation if they wish, it would be great if you open retail store in every city for direct selling also that would help us to see and check our product and get completely satisfied before buying. All ur product can also be sold in your retail store exclusively as well as can be ordered online. You can keep cost slightly higher on direct selling. This would give chance to customer in getting reviewing the product as well as making fast delivery.

21668	snm	May 19, 2015	Yes	Best for daily basic use	The phone is not for those heavy gamer. Design is very good considering the price.Material is good.don't think to get everything in this price. Camera quality is good for sharing on web.The camera have not much detail. Anyhow you can use different photo editing app to give a new look.  Sound quality is not good but its not also the worst.  Display is good but not comparable to moto e and mi.  Battery will last a day if you use it for some basic use,like chatting browsing etc.if u on net all time the screen time will be 4 hour with minimum brightness.  I will recommend not to play heavy games in it if u want long lasting of the device.  But there are many unnecessary app which you can disable.  Just i will say if u r a basic user and using some useful app like sbi anywhere, gmail,map,pdf viewer  etc then go for this. There is better option like infocus m2 whis has better quality camera and screen but the company is new so we may not get the service center. So better to choose micromax.The service has improved.

21744	Salman	May 19, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark Q380	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.Arun kumar

22131	Raj the technical expert.	May 18, 2015	Yes	Really good phone and awesome stuff in this range.	I bought the phone at the 6th may sale and got it on 11th. When i opened the box,i found that there is no battery in the box,then i noticed that it has a non removable battery. The mobile has a sleek and classy look.It looks like that you have some very expensive mobile.The mobile has all the features as shown in the specs.But has some cons and pros. PROS: 1.)Really good camera,back camera and front camera both are absolutely fine. Didn't expected that level from Micromax. 2.)The display is mind blowing, looks like HD screen,even when it is a qHD screen. 3.)Gorilla Glass 3 gives extreme protection to your phone, you won't have to use screen gaurd. Using a screen gaurd will bring more scratches than as usual. 4.)Android LOLLIPOP is awesome in looks and is also fine working. 5.)Internal storage is good in this range and also a good RAM of 1GB. runs all the apps needed. 6.)Touch is super sensitive and screen is like butter. Your fingers will slide over the screen. CONS: 1.)Overheating issues of mobile,the phone gets over heated after doing a little hard work.The area around the camera becomes so hot that your fingers can burn. 2.)The internal is quite good but it gives a headache that you can't transfer the files to SD card. Only 5 GB of space is given 3GB is already taken by mobileOS.Your internal will be filled easily,so install only those apps that you need. 3.)The phone has 1GB ram but even then it has some lagging issues(only sometimes) but that is not likely to be a con. 4.)The back panel of the mobile is classy but attracts a lot of finger prints and dust. So i recommend to buy the black model, white will get dirty very easily.  Over all the phone is a good selection at this price rate, you will not get GORILLA GLASS 3 at this price rate,8 + 2 MP camera  and quad core and the "BHAROSA" of  MICROMAX.
22132	KGKR	May 18, 2015	Yes	Spark	its nice phone. but when call or msg is coming.. in that time the screen light was not appear. its the main draw back. remaining is perfectly good.

22137	perk	May 18, 2015	Yes	Unbeatable deal at unbeatable price !!!!	This phone is great in all aspects at this price. Features of this phone are almost at par with the other good smart phones present in the market.  Amazingly sleek & classy look. Android lollipop 5.0.  Other phones which we can see with these specs is redmi 2 which is Rs 2000 costlier than this one.  The only problem with this phone is the speakers are not too loud.  Overall I am very happy with the piece at this amazing price !!!!

It doesn't get any better	i have purchased this micromax canvas Spark few days ago and if i wanna describe this smartphone in one word then its " AWESOME". i love this phone, pretty amazing. some few things that i liked are its slim design, back panel mat finish which doesn't let this phone to slip from hand, you can hold it in single hand, the things that i liked most are its amazing specifications like 8 GB internal memory from which around 4.5 GB is user available. 1 GB RAM and Quad-core 1.3 GHz which is really fast, IPS LCD touchscreen which have a pretty decent viewing experience. 8MP camera and 2 MP front camera which have good picture quality. Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is anti scratch proof and its amazing, you get android Lollipop also, it supports OTG feature also and this phone doesn't lag which you cant get in this mid cost smartphone, you have to pay above Rs 10,000 to get same kinda features smartphone. There is only one thing that i didnt like its that it has 2 sim slots but only slot 1 supports 3g and 2 slot supports 2G, but it doesnt matter that much because canvas spark have more positive points. so my advice is to buy this amazing phone because you will not regret it for sure.

ALL THE BEST MICROMAX KEEP ROCKING
22355	Roo	May 18, 2015	Yes	This is what you call a Value for Money Smart Phone!!!	You won't get better than this in this price tag, believe me its best from micromax till date in this price range.  The movement I unboxed it was actully a SPARK....looks good feels good & certainly it has excellent looks.  Pros: meets my requirements. Display is crisp n clear with good wide angle views. Sound output is decent. Rear camera takes good images in dark light. Front is also decent. Light weight. Browsing is fun as it as 1gb ram. Best of all it comes with latest Lollipop, still exploring it as its filled with new features.  Con's: earphones could have been better, but this price tag what more u can expect for. As off now no con's in Spark. But I'll be back with full detailed review.  Thank you.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

22509	Prakhar	May 17, 2015	Yes	Best ever at this price but camera requires patience !	The first thing i tried was camera, it takes much time to capture . But i was surprised with the video recorder quality . phone gets heated up soon as you start gaming high. Else everything is awesome. Phone do not support AC3 ...so you cannot play few movies with audio support. voice navigation,google voice support is awesome.Dr. Safety feature is helpful Hinglish keyboard is something i really wanted and have unexpectedly initially. Sure you can go for this piece doubtless.

22512	S Joshi	May 17, 2015	Yes	it's like u get more than what u have paid	It's a product with gr8 specifications..I personally think that 1gb ram, 8 mp camera n 8 GB internal memory is more than enough if u are a normal user... Other than that it's also loaded with latest android 5.0 lolipop version...which makes ur use easy... I think in this price it's excellent product...
22513	raj	May 17, 2015	Yes	it's good product within this budget	You shouldn't expect more features in this price. The camera hardware and especially look is pretty awesome. Though it is running on android lollipop some important features are still missed out. Like multi user. And have some minor software issues. Little heating problem is also there. But if you update android version you can overcome software issues. But this phone i strongly recommend to buy more valued than money.

Micromax Canvas spark contains the latest Android OS and more features  than my older phone that too at a lower price.  Pros: latest Android Lollipop, Brilliant colours, Mostly used Apps are present which includes Google play store, Whats app, facebook, etc. All recent games are present.Super 8 mp camera which captures photo more accurately and also contains special feature 'Live photo'.Sound is great in earphone and also through speaker output. ring tones are nice and ear catching. with the IPS screen the touch is too good.Phone is too light, slim and very handy.Design is perfect. Selfies are very nice with the additional pixels.   Cons: The only cons may be the builtin battery ( non-removable) and also power backup is medium.  Best uses: The phone is the best choice for smart phone beginners.It suits the taste of all like Officials , Students, workers, working women, sports person etc.. as there are applications to suits all taste at an affordable price. Actually one can think of all these feature at a cost of Rs. 8000 or more.

Gorilla Glass. 3. Very good looking user interface. 4. Sleek and style looking. 5. Great display and speaker. 6. Regular Games are good. Did not try with big games.  7. All other features till date are sooo good with few improvements mentioned below.  Cons : 1. Battery drains in less than a day with 3G. With 2G, more than a day. 2. A bit slow processing sometimes. One reboot in 2-3 days will set this good. 3. Recent Calls section is bit glitch when compared to old versions. Cannot copy numbers by long touch, cannot send SMS from recent calls list. 4. Takes 4 hours time to full charge.  To conclude, this is a really awesome mobile and toooo cheap when its features are considered.  100% recommended to buy. Enjoy.

22926	piyal	May 17, 2015	Yes	Budget Phone	This phone has so many interesting features which could lure anybody towards it. But the fact is , camera quality is very bad (8 Megapixel),if you compare with the Microsoft Lumia 535 having 5 Megapixel camera on  board .... then you realize the difference.     Battery is not so efficient as we expected. Otherwise, speed is good.     If you want a budget phone having LOLIPOP inside, then go for this ..... otherwise ... stay away !!!

The battery backup is decent.  But: The battery is non-removable. The SIM are both micro. So not that versatile.  Finally: Its a great device at this price and Android Lollipop 5.0 make much better.  A must have for those who don't care to make a couple of adjustments.

Still would recommend to go for Spark with no second thoughts...
23315	sani	May 16, 2015	Yes	super phone	this phone super phone in micromax brand  and super speed
23316	sehrawat	May 16, 2015	Yes	Gud looks; decent camera; lagging considerable.	summary given in title.
23317	reddy	May 16, 2015	Yes	better	batary back up is not gud
23318	Souvik	May 16, 2015	Yes	Awesome Product with this price range	After Micromax Yureka, This Product is awesome. No Lagging, And Comes with Good Size which is very handy, and also quick replay for Messaging. Pros:  1. No Lagging 2. 8 Mp camera is awesome for clicking normal pic. 3. Front camera is avg but Good for those who are uses video chat in skype cause less consuming date because of 2Mp. 4. Battery Backup also good(if you change the launcher 3 to nova launcher). 5. Comes with Lollipop and also gorilla glass with this range with micromax brand name. 6. Good for Normal Gaming.  Cons: 1. Battery is not removable. 1. Too much taking time for battery charging 0% to 100%( approx 4hours) 2. For Selfie Front cam is not good. Its liitle bit hazy. 3. Back cover is too thin.  Best Uses: Battery is not removable its ok cause in apple phone there was no option to remove battery. And its a best product because of its too handy, Clicking your memories with 8Mp, there is no option to get a scratch on your screen because its have gorilla glass. SO my opinion is that dont look at cons side, just go for it if you want to buy phone with 5000 range.
23319	kuntal	May 16, 2015	Yes	Really good	Nice phone. Snapdeal's service to good.I like to shop on snapDeal its very good to online shopping.

23325	Sangeeta Chaddha	May 16, 2015	Yes	Best budget Smartphone	Hey guys, this is my 2nd smartphone and I love this Canvas Spark. The phone doesn't hang at all, battery backup is pretty nice. The back camera is nice but front or selfie camera is below average but after looking at its price I would say both the cameras are nice. The phone comes with bundle of apps which you can remove easily. The looks premium from back but not so good from front, the function keys do not have any backlights so its makes the phone too bad from front. I have installed very heavy games but the phone like Iron man 3 and asphalt 8 but the doesn't lag at all. Android lollipop makes the phone too good in looks and makes the phone premium. The phone screen is beautifull, the viewing angles are so good but it can support videos at 720p. The phone also have 3 notification lights, it shows blue for whatsapp, green for messages and red for low battery. After using this smartphone I would say, if your budget is fixed at 5500 or 5000 then guys this is the best smartphone for you.

If you are first time buyers of smartphone go for it.It gives you nearlly eyerything you want to be in your smartphone.Overall Micromax canvas spark is a verydecent and affordable price smartphone.

PHONE WORKING VERY NICELY.HARDWARE IS VERY GOOD BUT THERE ARE MANY UN-USEFUL APPS GARBAGE PRELOADED WHICH IRRITATE ME.

23484	First time on Micromax	May 16, 2015	Yes	Value for money deal.	Q380 houses a descent configuration for a price tag of 4999/- INR.  Great look. Good camera performance. Fine display. Sweetness of Lollipop.  But earphone packed within the case does not come up to the expectation.  Not satisfied with audio reproducibility through earphone.  The USB Charger too feel like local made Chinese item..!!  Battery also drains for few hours of downloading over WiFi.  About 4 GB is available free to install extra additional apps.  All these are based on my 5 hour usage and further cons and pros are yet to be realised in coming days, I Hope.  But can't expect more than this at this price in today's market scenario.  Durability and other issues will be updated in coming days, So that other customers could get a clear picture of this item.

23496	Anubhav	May 16, 2015	Yes	Well built device by Micromax, Recommended for basic users.	I was never expecting this kind of built quality from Micromax, it's really above par. To summarize everything let me gave my views on it's Pros & Cons. Pros: 1- Well built & attractive, looks like a premiuk device  2- Multitasking is OK but still you can face lag due to it's processor. 3- Equiped with latest Android version out of the box. 4- Smartly priced.  Cons: 1- Camera doesn't seems at par, nothing like an 8MP camera & focus lock is really slow sometimes. 2- UI is slow even with 1GB RAM & Stock android, advance user can easily feel it.  Overall: I would not recommend this device to advance users, who have already used a good Android device but for new users, this device is like a must buy. Not a bad experience, everything is acceptable in that price, yet I was expecting a better camera. And 5 stars for the looks, feels premium though it's plastic.

23508	moti	May 16, 2015	Yes	Just a normal phone.	Being a previous user and a loyalist of micro max mobile, i bought this canvas spark,looking to the good internal memory,the camera front & back and being built with corning gorilla glass.slim body, dual sim and much more tempted me to buy this mobile. but to my disappointment whilst using whats app, i find that the scrolling the messages they just roll down at jet speed,this seems to be very strange. this never used to happen in my earlier mircomax ninja. i suppose the tech team hasnt checked on this.

23539	Atin garg	May 16, 2015	Yes	Good Product in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp till time Battery backup is average, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

23635	Vivek Anandh	May 15, 2015	Yes	Good stuff that worth buying at this price.	The build quality was good. With a matte finish the phone become more handy.  Rear Camera quality was good but the front camera fails to impress us during room lightings or low lightning. The display was bit OK which we can see pixelisation.  Overall good stuff (Good,Bad and worth) The Phone comes with too much bloatwares. So that's little frustrating.  The phones launcher was a custom launcher so we have to download GOOGLE now Launcher to experience pure performance. Android os was 5.0 with a sure update in future with the latest version by micromax ota update service.  No WiFi connectivity issues. I never find any problems in networks. The 3G sim slot doing a good job.  Please don't miss this mobile.  Thank you.

23776	ashish rath	May 15, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Good value for money product. I am writing this review after using the phone for 2 weeks.  +ve Points: Display is really good coz of HD; Slim and design is good and does not look cheap; Back panel is scratch resistant; NO Performance issue. Battery easily lasts 1 day with 3g ON. No heating issues observed till now.  -ve Points: Camera not upto the mark; In HD mode photo capture takes a lot of time. That too end result is not good. Disappointed with camera but still can manage looking at the price phone was offered. No backlight for the buttons.  So final verdict if not bothered about a average camera this is Must buy.

23855	Supremo	May 15, 2015	Yes	Good One for moderate users and newbies	Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 has good specs as compare to its rivals. First of all,I would like to say... It's SAR Value(0.29w/kg @ Head, 0.42w/kg @ Body) makes great deal for anybody who wants smartphone within this price range(5K-7K). Secondly, Android Lollipop and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 are the strong points to look at this device to buy. Moreover, It is considerably thin(8.5mm) and light weight(134grams only). 2000mAh battery lasts longer(36-40Hrs) when you turn on Battery Saver feature "ON for always"- Offcourse, slower the performance. I obeserved some frame drops and lags while playing the game-Despicable Me and heated up little. Anyhow, other basic games played well on this device. Rear Camera performance is above average. Front Camera is OK. These few drawbacks will not bother newbies and moderate users, that's why, I put headline like that and rated 5 stars keeping these issues in my mind. Lastly, think about SAR Values and go for smartphone and you will not regret.
23856	Sonal Sharma	May 15, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Very good & lovely phone. It's very slim & light phone.

23861	Jacklin	May 15, 2015	Yes	its a thing that will work for you under this budgeted price	Bought this product on Snap deal first flash sale on 29 Apr'2015. As promised timely delivery and good packaging, found all the contents in the box as specified.  My sole intention on buying this phone was that it had an upgraded android version and also good features within a budgeted price.  Just had a try and believe me since this is my first product on snap deal which I got real trust about the service and feedback till the item got delivered at my door step, before i decided to write any reviews waited to see how this product functions and after using the phone for nearly ten days i have  finally decided to put forth my views about the phone so that it can be very much useful to eagerly awaiting customers who wish or not to buy this phone.  Here are my pros and cons about the phone- Pros a) phone is easy to operate with no lags b) Nice looks, touch screen is great - Cons - a) Battery backup is poor b) Sound is little bit low. Despite of the shortcomings and after usage for more than one week, I feel that the product is worth buying and very happy to be the owner of this smartphone which has mostly all the features in a branded name smartphones and within this price range. Unbelievable

24103	Teja Karlapudi	May 14, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Coring Gorilla Glass 3, OTG support & 8gb internal memory at 5k. These are the coolest features you can ever get for 5k.but after few days I got used to it and it's fine. The phone looks very elegant & premium. Camera is pretty average. If you want the best software experience & performance go with Canvas A1 but you have to compromise on those 3 features which I mentioned in the 1st line. Finally, Canvas Spark is one of the best phone you cant at 5k and trust me you won't be worried after you buy it.  The phone is a great deal for the price. However the OS is not as smooth as Canvas A1 (Android One) for obvious reasons. I see lags sometimes but it's fine. But don't get me wrong, this phone has the best micromax os I have ever seen before (micromax kitkat os looked cheap and buggy).  In-Hand feel isn't that great when I got it  I have used both Canvas spark and Canvas A1 before writing this review.

24110	Mohanraj.M	May 14, 2015	Yes	Canvas spark is sparkling	Micromax Canvas spark Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is not good, speaker not soloud, installed apps are not very useful taking too much RAM space.  Overall: Better phone for ladies as it is very slim. The device is doing the job for the price paid and I think it is nice and slim smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 5000 - 7000 then best is to go for this.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

24315	Krishna	May 14, 2015	Yes	Good product, value for money!! definietly worth it.	I received the product from Snapdeal within a couple of days, the device was in perfect condition. As being a moderate user i tested the device in many ways, but the interface was still fluid and ultra smooth. but there's a problem regarding the built quality, i may sound a bit overdoing, but still i noticed some flaws. And they are as follows. 1. the notification LED placed under the speaker grill was not installed properly, it was a bit slanted towards the left side in the device which didn't gave a good amount of feed back.   2. the left touch to use button of device, was not working that perfectly, the device was lagging a bit while swiching through the apps.  3. the back panel, a tiny body lock of the panel didn't got fit with the body.  besides these points the device and the accessories were working perfectly. hats off to the gorilla glass 3.  Pros- perfect built, slim body, great cameras, good sound quality, great display and an unimaginable fluid UI.  Cons-the back camera is a bit popped out of body which makes it a bit fragile.  To the best of my belief you can go for the Micromax Canvas Spark undoubltly.
24316	Sathiz	May 14, 2015	Yes	Micromax Canvas Spark Q380	Mobile is worth for money. value add benefits are in this mobile.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

24438	Abhishek HAikwad	May 14, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Overall Satisfied with both Micromax and Snapdeal because I received my phone within 20 hours. Pros: 1.Jaw dropping Price :) 2.HD display - Display clarity is really amazing, vivid and bright 3.Updated lollipop OS 4.Gaming is also good, touch response is nice. 5.8MP rear camera with good flash, front camera is ok.  6.Light weight and slim. 7.Louder and clear sound. 8.Good battery backup. enough for 24hrs with average gaming,  WIFI, browsing and chatting in whatsapp and facebook.  Cons: Honestly speaking, I didn't find any remarkable one. You can't expect high performance and other impressive features in such a low budget phone. Micromax Spark is best competitor to Moto E, Redmi 1s in this price range. Go for it with any doubt!!

24817	Shruthi	May 14, 2015	Yes	Perfect!	I was on the lookout for a budget smartphone to be given as a gift. I couldn't have asked for anything better than the Canvas Spark, a very affordable power-packed smartphone that delivers a punch.  Pros: Android 5.0 Lollipop, amazing processing speed, no lags, clear display, Corning Gorilla Glass protection Cons: The phone comes with a number of pre-installed apps, most of which are not of use and which cannot be installed. These apps consume more than half of the internal 8 GB storage. Battery backup is average. Also, the battery is not removable, so you cannot pop in a spare battery on the go. Overall: The cons are few and can be easily overlooked for a smartphone of this price range. I absolutely loved the device. This is probably the best budget smartphone available today.

Regarding the Phone , the Phone has a Few Issues in it . Number one issue in phone is that of Performance, even though with ROM they offer, the Hanging issue is common in the phone. THe Movability option among different apps is not there, so juggling between apps is a major problem in the phone. The camera does not work well in night time., Screen size and Resolution is good. Overall the Product in this segment is disappointing keeping in mind other have delivered better performing products in same price range.

I'll give you some pros and cons of this budget smartphone: PROS: 1 GB RAM just fair for budget smartphone 8gb ROM good for normal user 8mp Primary Camera shoots decent picture in proper lighting conditions Great value for money 4.7-inch qHD IPS display Gorilla Glass 3 screen protection Just 8.5 mm Slim & lightweight Dual SIM Support 2000mah Decent battery backup 3G Support Latest Android OS Lollipop Design & build quality is good with metallic design 1.3ghtz Midea Tec quad-core Processor for multitasking USB ON THE GO support (OTG support) Cons: No 4G support Compass is missing Average selfies with front camera Earphones quality is not up to the mark We can see that this budget entry level smartphone has many good pros specifications which we don't get while spending at least 7k price, so I appreciate MICROMAX for this awesome smartphone.  A big THUMBS UP to SPARK, and great job MICROMAX.

Would like to say like back cover ( White ) is catching yellowness in just couple of weeks as covers are not available in the market due to newer model of handset. Just another point is that phone handset is very slippery, so for protection of handset always buy protective cover. I heard about another company which also provide good quality of hardware are offering protective covers... if the same is from our favourite brand Micromax, we wan"t mind to pay extra cost as it can give us more pleasure to use the beautiful product for longer tenure.  In one liner EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH AWESOME PRICE BAND

The phone accepts two Micro-SIM cards, of which at least one can connect to a 3G network. Rounding off the other connectivity options are Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Bluetooth v4.0.

25185	pal	May 12, 2015	Yes	I'll buy this product again	Good phone love did phone
25186	Aadarsh Singh	May 12, 2015	Yes	Such a nice gadget by micromax....Awesome smartphone	This is really awesome gadget...nice features...I have purchased micromax canvas spark in 1st sale..I absolutely love this phone. It's the best one I've ever had. The battery lasts forever and it takes amazingly clear photos. It runs really fast and I never have problems with it messing up. Really great smartphone in smart price...I really recommended to purchase this phone n enjoy with lollipop...
25187	Sunstar	May 12, 2015	Yes	Must buy for budget under 5000	The Canvas Spark is an ultra-budget smartphone, therefore obviously it has limitations.  That said we could have lived with some of these limitations, but as things stand today we have choices, and clearly better ones. You may argue, there are not many good handsets at Rs.4,999 which is right to some extent.  But we cannot totally wrap our minds around the Spark because of its inconsistent nature and heating woes. If you're a first timer looking to enter the world of Android, this one should make more sense for you especially since you're getting Lollipop out-of-the-box.  But beyond that, the InFocus M2 is every bit a better handset than this one. Also, if you can spend a little more and go for the Moto E (Gen 2) or the Redmi 2, there's nothing like that.
25188	sahilgharat2014	May 12, 2015	Yes	micromax canvas spark	The micromax canvas spark is better .even performance is nice. Camera is excellent  . but loud speaker is quit good . please come with mobile cover it's not available in MCC market.

25190	Lucky the rockstar	May 12, 2015	Yes	Nice one	Perfect mobile ever
25191	prashanth	May 12, 2015	Yes	True value for Money	We cannot say it is a master piece from Micromax. Still we can say it is true value for money. It is the best in class quality at its price range. still it has its own limitations like poor battery backup and wait. But its look is awesome and can be comparable to any high end model. For this value I can suggest my friends to purchase by closed eyes.
25192	Aneesh Olathanni	May 12, 2015	Yes	AWESOME SLIM PHONE...........................

25224	Ramon Zarate	May 12, 2015	Yes	Awesome device at low price	I bought this phone for my mom as a gift. I myself am using micromax canvas nitro A310 which is a high end smart phone costing around 12k. Delivery was quick and packing was good.I help setup the phone for my mom and installed all the apps and signed on to google etc but at no time did i feel that canvas spark was any lesser than my own canvas nitro. Smooth touch,slim design, good camera,built in android lollipop, flash/torch,good wifi and bluetooth connectivity,excellent brightness levels,able to play full hd videos without any flaw. what more could any one ask for? Anyway my mom was pleasently suprised and is happily using this phone. I was glad i could put a smile on my mom's face. There were some cons which you expect when the price is so low. The speaker sound is average, lots of additional not required builtin apps which cannot be uninstalled,headphones give infirior sound quality (not low) but poor quality.one more thing is one sim slot is GSM and other is WCDMA whatever that means. over all its a awesome buy for me. Happy with Micromax.

Everyone aware of the specs of this wonderful device & so, i don wanna discuss on it. The thing we need to compromise is, it comes with non-removable 2000 mAh Li-On Battery.. we have to go the authorised service only to replace the same. Apart from it, no issues. Quality of the camera is good. No heating isssues. Battery backup is decent. Somewhat this device resembles like Moto G.

25728	Rajesh V R	May 09, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Love it.  Promptly dispatched on sale day, reached me on 03 May.  things to love :::  Lollipop  Quad core Processor LED Charging / notification indicator near speaker slim and sleek , light weight 4+ GB of internal storage (much needed for lollipop) good battery performance (can use internet for half hr or more even under 15% battery!) Hardware home / menu / back buttons volume rocker and power button ergonomically placed on right side. best phone i would think under 5k range. descent camera quality Instant GPS fix  Cons: Lollipop 5.1 update not available (of course you have cons of lollipop itself) notification indicator needs keen eye to be noticed!!!! very small, but its there, better than nothing no LED indicators in hardware home buttons. non removable battery (not much of a problem, though) headset is ok type but regular good micromax headsets arent working with this standard, not all 3.5 mm headsets are supported. back cover feels too thin (they've made it too thin to give up on weight!!!) matt finish is ergonomic, though Not a micromax issue - lollipop eats up almost 50%-100% extra space for each app to make app cache and perform better - new tech theyve employed !!! camera could have been a bit better Can't find options for AGPS.   overall, im satisfied.

25745	raj	May 09, 2015	Yes	OK	This product is OK and sold at reasonable price. But I suggest when ever you make agreement with sellers like micromax or others suppliers, Insist them to supply accessories like flip cover/ case cover. This will make complete success of product. Otherwise These tricks of selling few pieces of mobiles every week will not work as it will be understood by buyers as public are getting more and more awareness day by day socially. Example: Redme2 is now readily available on two ecommerce websites. This happened because saturation stage has arrived. Making low availability will not be successful anymore.
25746	Pradeep tiwari	May 09, 2015	Yes	I would buy this product again and again	this is the best mobile in minimum rate. thanx but back cover & flip cover not available in market pls provide in your snapdeal if available.

And one more important thing downloaded apps cnnot be transferred to sdcard but as it has 8gb internal memory this thing can b avoided. mobile is slightly getting heated up if we use for more than 15 mins. battery will drain 10% in we play games for half hour. not but least all these things can b aboided  My cousin nd 2 frnd r also planning to purchase this mobile after  seeing  my mobile

25753	Satish Pandey	May 09, 2015	Yes	Not Too Bad.......	Good Phone In This Budget, But If You Could Ignore Gorilla Glass 3 I'll Suggest You To Go For Infocus M2 In Same Budget... Camera Is Not Too Good, Clarity Is Missing Somewhere, Battery Backup Is Quite Good, No Lags, Sound Is Not Loud.. It's Display Is Bigger Than M2 But ppi Is Less.

Except display size, infocus m2 is better than canvas spark like wise: Performance,camera,picture quality,display etc. If anyone who don't want to Infocus  brand;than canvas spark is OK..
25785	Sujith Kumar	May 09, 2015	Yes	A great Phone at this Price	A great phone with all the latest features and a decent specification with the latest Android Lollipop version. Its slim and light build coupled with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 gives the phone a rich and pleasant feel. The high speed processor along with 1GB RAM provides great speed for all normal operations as well as regular multitasking needs.The included Hands free is decent. The non removable battery however is a little dampener. The numerous pre-installed apps is also a irritant. Overall a great phone at this price range.

25803	Greatsanghvi	May 08, 2015	Yes	value for money	beast in class
25804	Aakash	May 08, 2015	Yes	Extremely Powerful and Stylish Smartphone Ever	Best Smartphone packed with 8 Megapixel Largan Lens Camera, Android 5.0 at such a low price. The phone is very good in terms of exterior design and is ergonomic. Its sleek design is easy to carry and looks awesome. Performance never compromises while it be Gaming or Multi-Applications Processing. The Micromax Canvas Spark Q380 has extremely good speakers and microphones that are audible even in heavy traffic. The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 adds the protection none like others. The battery is very good for talktime and I use it the most for gaming and it serves the best. The Mali-400 GPU makes the game to run smooth and never lag also in full graphics. It suppors OTG which is the best part of the Android 5.0. Also the charging time is very less (around 1.5hrs) from 16% battery. Snapdeal you're the best to provide this Extremely Powerful Smartphone at this price.
25805	R@hul	May 08, 2015	Yes	:)	It's awesome device in best price. firstly no heating on charging or playing games good camera  good processing with nice touch control and also no hanging or lag problem hands-free is not so good but desirable. battery backup like other phones.. means on heavy use 3.5 hour on 3g or gaming. in apps cpu-z and droidinfo if you use those apps on launching mmx q380 auto restart this is bad news for us. but finally i suggested to all of you go with it because its best android phone with awesome price.
25806	Vikudube	May 08, 2015	Yes	Good at this price	Good phone at this price
25807	pavan the tiger	May 08, 2015	Yes	certainly a good product.	This is a good product if you want to experience android lollipop in budget then I recommended to buy this phone.

25809	Aksh	May 08, 2015	Yes	Better product at lower cost	Little slower operation compared to other kitkat,jelly bean
25810	JP	May 08, 2015	Yes	Just what I was looking for!	A nice Android phone worth its price! Looks are simply beautiful with slim design. 8.0 mp rear camera and 2.0 mp front camera give excellent results for day-to-day use. Screen resolution is excellent. Very good battery life. The only thing I would have liked is it should have come with normal GSM sim, whereas this device has one micro GSM slim slot and one micro WCDMA sim.
25811	ABHINAV DUBEY	May 08, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Its a budget mobile for new user and I will give one more star if battery will be removable......

I have always been a micromax fan in the way they deliver the value for every rupee I spend with them.   Spark looks very stylish - atleast better than my A77 juice that I own.  The touch -feel of back panel is awesome.  Call quality, speaker volume are good Its for the first time that I dare use Front camera ! Rear Camera too is good at this price point Comes with 4 GB memory and some good pre installed apps Performace wise too, its been good till now - battery though only 2k mah, works to satisfaction  Overall I am very enthused with the new device

25895	Sidd	May 08, 2015	Yes	Just like my Galaxy S3!	I bought the phone as a backup option, as my 2.5yrs old S3 had started giving some signs of being on the verge of dying.  The phone is absolutely perfect, with great 8MP back shooter and 2MP front shooter with image qualities almost at par with my S3.  The front glass does attracts some fingerprints, but then a screen guard is provided with it.  The resolution, though might seem low on paper, but in reality, it seems quite crisp.  The back cover looks really sturdy, though the white one might attract some dust over time, especially given that no good cases are available for the device yet.  The pre-installed apps are many, but some of them (almost half of them) are removable. The ones from Micromax are non user removable. But, one can always root the phone and remove those useless apps.  The Android Lollipop, out of the box runs awesome on the phone. Though, I'm aware that further updates might not be rolled for the device anytime soon or in future.  The only things I could have asked for more were a better speaker, a better notification light, and a better set of earphones (yes, even at this price range!)

25966	Keny	May 07, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in Just 4999/-	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

25977	Chirag Anand	May 07, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	I am pretty satisfied with the phone considering the fact that it has lollipop running out of the box and it comes with pretty descent camera and i personally loved the display of the phone, the colours are vibrant, the details are crisp. It does support USB-OTG which very nice. The internal storage is good enough. However there are some things that I would like to mention like it is unable to make or receive video calls despite having having 3G connectivity and front facing camera. There are some times when you can notice some interuptions in UI, the FPS does lags sometimes. Also I faced issues with date & time, they automatically gets changed on boot, even though I changed them to manual. Despite these things the phone is a good buy for 5K price, you can give it a shot.

26097	SANKA KANAKA KRUPAKAR	May 05, 2015	Yes	Micromax canvas spark	I have purchase this on snapdeal, tuch screen not good & speed also very less,over all not good this price.
26098	Arpit ASR	May 05, 2015	Yes	Great phone	I have used a lot of mobile phones, specially Android phones but at this price Micromax Canvas Spark is an awesome phone. It has nice looks, touch is good. Slim design but poor battery backup and speaker volume. Overall I'm happy with the phone.
26099	Manish Sharma	May 05, 2015	Yes	Average, Ordinary	This phone has excellent hardware but OS i.e. Micromax Android Lollipop couldn't met it's requirements. It supports 32 GB SD Card but there is no option to move apps to SD Card. When you view images it shows pics from either internal storage or SD Card only. Many apps aren't compatible with Android Lollipop :(   Hope for update from Micromax with a lot of fixes.

26102	raja	May 05, 2015	Yes	awesome mobile	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
