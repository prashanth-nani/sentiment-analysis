5	Srinivas G	Feb 05, 2016	Yes	display is poor	I have a mobile of other brand which I use everyday for at least 6 hours.But 30 minutes of usage of this iball phone headaches me. Also a small turn from straight doesn't show the screen. Perhaps this is the problem of iball. Even iball ips display faces the same problem..
