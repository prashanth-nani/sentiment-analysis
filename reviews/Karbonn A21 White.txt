1	Neeraz	Feb 07, 2015	Yes	Totally love this product	I bought this phone to gift it to my GF on her birthday and i saw the quality is too food for the price they are offering and its been 1 and half years already she uses this phone for the regular use and the phone performs pretty well. We usually do the viber and skype calls and the quality i found i pretty decent. This phone can run more apps than my sony erission phone i am using and is amazingly faster for this price ranger. Camera is pretty decent as well for the 5 megapixel but not upto the mark and is more than required for the daily usage. Battery backup is good. The only issue is the sound as it is too low on handset but too good sound experience on headphones and the charger socket catches the case cover for the first some usage then is fine. I got with a screen guard thats nice as well and the screen size if pretty decent as she watches youtube and movies in this device only. I would really say if you are in delimma to buy this phone please dont be in delimma this is a good phone and i got no issues regarding this device till time.. Impressive design and product by karbonn.

10	Vinod	Feb 07, 2015	Yes	I like Karbonn A21	I wanted a budget phone. I am happy that I bought Karbonn A21 on recommendation of my younger brother. It is a nice phone with good camera which lets me click awesome shots. 5 MP camera is really good. I bought this phone for its impressive features, lightweight, and its price. It is reasonably priced and can be ordered easily online at Snapdeal.com. Some cons of this mobile include no HD video recording and tight charging slot. I wish it was good on these parameters too. The best part is that there is a face detection feature as well. Buy it!  Collected through an in-person interaction with the customer
11	Anu	May 17, 2013	Yes	Good Phone	Nice Phone though heavy weight good pic quality enough sound as it should not damage ears too.Easy to use.
12	Pramod	May 17, 2013	Yes	Make an informed decision	In this technological day and age, a lot of advanced phones have come out. However, my budget was not that high so I thought of buying Karbonn A21 as one of my friends has been using it. I don't regret my decision of buying the phone, but I don't consider it that good as well. The phone is pretty good but has some issues as well.  The quality of frontal camera, though 1.3MP, is rather sluggish. It is slim, stylish, and sleek. But the touchscreen is a little hard.  It is bit tough to remove the charger pin as when I do so; the plastic comes out, which is rather disappointing.  So see if it works for you or not!

13	Abhiranjan	May 17, 2013	Yes	You can Buy It	I have been using Karbonn A21 for about 20 days now and I have no issues with the mobile so far. There are a lot of good things about the mobile which makes it a good buying option. Some of these are: • Good for browsing and watching videos • Dual core processor is good and cellular signals are good • Primary camera is really good; but can't say the same about its front camera. You can take panorama shots as well • Excellent phone charging (and discharges even faster: p). But I find it okay as it is a common problem with most of the phones these days  Collected through an in-person interaction with the customer
14	Prabhash	May 17, 2013	Yes	Good for me	I got this amazing phone a week back.  It is my first phone and I am really excited to use it in a long run.  I don't know what experience users had with this phone, but till now, I am really happy about the phone.  Backed with Android 4.0 (ICS) operating system, this phone is good for users who love touchscreen and good quality camera. It has a 5MP primary camera and 1.3 MP front camera.  Video recording, big 4.5 inch screen, music player, video player, and radio are a few good features of this amazing phone.  With a good display and easy controls, it is quite fun using this Karbonn phone. I would recommend you to buy this phone from Snapdeal.com which is a very good online shopping store. Even I also made a purchase for this mobile at Snapdeal.com only, and trust me their services and deliveries are par excellence. You would never be disappointed. Consider yourself lucky if you can find some discount code and avail other benefits at Snapdeal.com. I would certainly recommend this phone to all those who love a medium-range phone and all those applications that can help them stay in touch with the world.  You can expect fast delivery and high quality products from Snapdeal.com. Moreover, you can get hands on this phone on an EMI basis, in case you don't want to shell money in one go.

17	Chan	May 17, 2013	No	Karbonn A21 - Go for it	Great to use, good battery life, flow of apps is simple. Navigation is easy to use, switching on off data & wifi is very easy. Only glitch is RAM size which is 400 mb only, so if you have many processes on will make the device slow.
