1	Karthik	Dec 03, 2015	Yes	Good Price and delivery	The price is better than all online sites and delivery without extra cost. We started using the device and it is very little better than iPhone 6 Plus.
2	Puli	Dec 03, 2015	Yes	It's awesome	The inner joy you will feel after using this device cannot ve explain in words. If you even feel like comparing this device with any phone I think you are fooling yourself. No detail explaination needed. Simply own one and get yourself at peace.also thanks snapdeal that got in low prices compared Amazon and Filpkart.
