22	russou	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	should buy	Nice deal This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands. By Amar from, delhi
23	rinnie	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	A very good product within budget	Just an amazing phone as I had dreamt off. I am using this phone since 5 months. After watching the phon, my 6 classmates too bought same phone. The HTC 820 is not only winning the hearts with dashing looks but also cuz of its performance. Phone is amazingly fast. Can perform multiple tasks efficiently without any pause.  I liked no. Of things about the phone which would be hard to mention in this small column just like when phone is ringing and when you hold the phone, its volume level gets decreased. this makes your phone insanely smarter than others.  Pros - Amazing primary and selfie camera, fast processor and handsome looks  Cons - Device heats too much sometimes when you are using it without any pause. this hurts. I feel like my hand will burn  Overall - Phone is amazing. I won't like to give away my phone for the world
24	Sovan Manna	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	amazing device, gorgeous looks and slim desgine	amazing device.. I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.

32	Jitendra	May 31, 2015	Yes	A phone with smooth performance and with great quality.	This is the best phone in the range of 15K to 25K. The only problem you will face is the battery backup. Its not so bad but neither so good.2600Mah battery is not enough for 5.5 inches phone with 267 PPI;it should be atleast 3000Mah.Otherwise everything in this phone is just awesome.Very smooth performance and very sexy look.

42	Rana	May 24, 2015	Yes	Recommended product to everyone except gamers.	HTC desire 820-good product. Very attractive design, stylish and status symbol too, but poor plastic quality. Sound quality is superb. U can enjoy the music like anything. Front and rear camera quality is very nice. Touch & overall performance of the phone is good. No lagging while playing heavy games like Asphalt and full hd videos. But only drawback with this phone is, battery. U have to charge the phone for every 16 hrs.(approx.)even u put it in idle. And while charging the battery, playing even low range games (like temple run/subway surfer) and playing videos, it will over heat like anything (reaches upto 46deg).  Anyhow, except battery issue this phone is very nice. You can buy it without second thought. Thax for reading my review. Welcome to HTC family.

44	Sunny	May 24, 2015	Yes	Awesome Mid-Ranger	This phone is amazing....strong contender in the mid-range segment.

Would have given a 5 star rating if the camera was a little better at taking pics especially in low light conditions.    Overall a terrific package. Can be a low priced alternative to the high end premium phones like m8, Sony z3 etc.
187	amir	Mar 02, 2015	Yes	BIG HAPPINESS COMES IN SMALL PACKAGES	I've been using HTC since 8 years from now and just like every HTC product i've used in the past, this one too is excellent in every aspect. The battery backup is good and you won't experience any heating issues. Every other phone tends to heat up when subjected to heavy usage, so its all normal. I highly recommend this phone.

189	gokhale	Mar 02, 2015	Yes	fantastic phone in its price range	I would give5 stars instead of4. The only problem I noticed is..... its heading up little.it will be a big problem for heavy gamers.but I don't play games in phablets . Max I can play chess which is very simple for its ram.

But Snapdeal took so much tine to deliver the phone. 4 Business for a domestic delivery is too much is what I feel. looking for good service4 from snap deal. Given ratings are only bcoz of phone performance.;)
205	prof	Feb 20, 2015	Yes	One of the best in midrange	This one is perhaps one of the best phones in midrange mobiles. I also purchased a one plus one 64 GB at the same price range. Of course it is difficult to beat One plus  in specs. But the dual sim feature is the one I was looking for. I had to cut my standard sims to nano in order to put them in 820, but after that it was smooth sailing. I am not a fan of HTC UI, in fact some features I dislike. Other than that there is a slight heating when I was reloading my data from google over some time. Except for these minor complains I do not hold anything against this mobile. People complain about the plasticky look, but once you use a good quality flip cover it looks all right.
206	Chetan	Feb 20, 2015	Yes	perfect in all respects	Best in the class

It is easy to hold and carry. One of the drawback is its battery backup, still it works for a day. It would have been better if it was equipped with higher capacity better.
226	Prakash Gayad	Feb 04, 2015	Yes	Bad battery	Actually the phone is superb no question about it . but its 2600mAh Li-Po battery is very bad and it just ends up in 5-6 hours and this is not enough to use the phone at its full extent.

253	Pranesh	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Good Phone and Excellent Servie	I have received the order in 3 working days from snapdeal. First the packing was amazing. Regarding the phone, it's fantastic and working well. Buy this phone if you are seeking the below in a smartphone; 1. Big Diplay 2. If you a lover of great brands like HTC, Samsung or Sony (or you've many options in the market) 3. Bright color 4. Good camera 4. Sanapdragon processor in a mid-rage phone 5. If you need a dual sim phone  My review about this phone:  The phone's plastic body is looking good but there are chances to get scratch easy and slippery. The button placement is a lot more convenient and the Desire 820 seems to offer a more polished experience as a whole. he camera on the phone is rather uncomfortably big and very protruding. The lens is also placed so near to the edge of the device that you have to be extremely careful while shooting in landscape mode so you don't accidentally cover it. n one hand, the top and bottom plastic plates encasing the BoomSound speakers are made of a nice matte plastic. But on the other, it is really a shame that the rest of the unibody is coated with less than premium glossy material, which happens to be in love with finger-prints. SIM and SD slots are positioned on the side of the Desire 820, nicely tugged away behind a plastic flap in their own little compartment. We weren't too eager to play around with it as it seems kind of flimsy and could potentially suffer if caught on a pocket edge or other piece of clothing. On the other hand, this setup does offer ease of access to the cards and is a welcome sight with all the recent cradle and caddy designs, which are often a struggle. The HTC Desire 820 is equipped with a 5.5-inch 720p display. It is nothing spectacular by today's standards, but is nonetheless, a solid choice for a mid-range smartphone. With its 267ppi it falls just a little short of what's become known as Retina-grade pixel density (300+ppi). As already mentioned the panel is identical to that found in its predecessor - the Desire 816 and is consequently plagued by much the same problems. The HTC Desire 820 is equipped with a rather modest 2,600 mAh battery. It is also absolutely identical to the one found in the Desire 816, but surprisingly enough, while the Desire 816 scored quite favorably at 64h, this is not exactly true for the phone at hand. Our tests showed an oddly low 49h endurance rating and may we remind that this is a mixed result from fairly favorable conditions. We had the display set to 50% brightness and frankly, this made it too dim to be comfortably used outdoors even on an overcast day.
254	James	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Don't think, Just Go For It !!	Design :  it features the same dual front-firing speakers of its siblings. At the same time, it's accompanied with the usual suspect of ports and buttons around its trim – they include its power button, volume control, microphones, microUSB 2.0 port, and 3.5mm headset jack. Another unique characteristic of the Desire 820 is that it's a dual-SIM device  Display: HTC 820 has a 5.5-inch 720 x 1280 LCD display. Size is undoubtedly one of its assets, but it's not particularly the sharpest tool in the shed with its pixel density count of 267 pixels per inch. However, we find it acceptable enough taking into account its class.  SOUND : BoomSound, need I say more?? for those who do not know, BOOMSOUND is absolutely killer and the best sound system you will find on any smartphone. They are loud, crisp and the lows, mids and highs are perfect.  CONNECTIVITY:  4G at this price?? unbelievable for an HTC device. It supports all other connectivity options like WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth etc  BATTERY : 2600 mAh seems small but M8 has the same battery with full HD screen and lasts for more than 1 day. So this device will give you good backup as it has only 720P screen.  RAM : 2GB RAM is great. good for multitasking.  PROS:: BoomSound, Sense 6 UI, Design, Performance, 4G CONS :: 720P screen (but they have to cut the costs)
255	Nimi	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Awesome Phone	Best phone in this price it has everything needed
256	Tarun	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	'BEAST'	WOW..Htc is a world leader in technology and Htc desire 820 is the prime example of that..It's not a famous brand but it's definitely better than Samsung and overpriced Sony.
257	manish	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	perfect	awasome snapdeal fr delivered my product.
258	Guest	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	camera needs improvement	Gud phone at gud price but pictures not according to 13 mp camera.
259	Arun	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Perfect for Business People	The phone is very much capable. It looks very nice, having perfect color combination, looks slim and compatible to use. The speed and clarity should very much be appreciable. The draw backs are heat generated by the device and the low battery capacity.
260	g.sathwik20	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	HTC DESIRE 820 (truly desirable)	completely satisfied with the product.. gr8 experience with SNAPDEAL  :)
261	iskimran90	Jan 19, 2015	Yes	value for money	Dont think twice to buy it.fabulous phone .just mind blowing.
262	Subrat Pandey	Jan 19, 2015	Yes	Killer Combination at this price tag.	1. Market's First Octa-Core Processor phone. 2. Yes, it works on 4G.  Likewise, there are few other incorrect details about this phone on snapdeal. And , believe me , the actual details will make you feel more good.  Correct configuration: Operating System : Android v4.4.4 (KitKat)  Screen size:  5.5 Inch, 720x1280 px display, LCD  Processor :  Octa core 1.7 GHz processor  Camera : 13 MP Primary Camera, 8 MP Secondary  Dual SIM : SIM1 - 4G/3G/2G, SIM2- 3G/2G  RAM :  2 GB RAM  Battery   : 2600 mAh, Li-Polymer battery  Storage  : 16 GB Internal Memory, Expandable up to 128 GB.  I finalized this phone after reviewing OnePlus/Mi4, because they were single SIM . Also , HTC is a bigger and more trusted brand name than One Plus/Xiaomi offering Dual SIM phone almost same features in same range.  The phone is looks really elegant and the touch is smooth as silk. Snapdeal also provided a free MoLife Flip cover with it. Definitely a Must buy on anybody's list.
263	Ramarao	Jan 19, 2015	Yes	very goodproduct	Very good performance and very much satisfied with speedy download

269	Neeraj	Jan 19, 2015	Yes	Best phone under 25 K	Hello Everyone,  I am writing this review after using HTC Desire 820 for 2 weeks. First of all, I would like to thank snap deal for delivering this product with in 2 days.   Perfromace of HTC 820 is very good. it does not hang even on running high end games. True gaming phone. While running multiple apps performace is very good and working with this phone is like piece of cake.   battery back up is exeptional and with moderate use I am easily able to use it for 2 days.   Both Camera are superb and image and videos taken from this phone are very good. Body and curves of this phone is very sytle. I feel proud taking this phone in my hand. Very Slim.
270	RIVIDO	Jan 19, 2015	Yes	HTC has Hit the NAIL on the HEAD	now this is what makes a phone a smart phone, and htc has gone ahead and made it perfect. Configuration with a 2 GB ram and 1.5 GHZ quad core processor this is super fast. Display Super LCD 2 with HD display. pictures and movies are crisp and sharp with excellent detailing. Camera 13 MP Primary camera that has an eye for details and an 8 MP front camera for the selfie freaks. the front camera is a marveL AND THE PRIMARY CAMERA IS SUPER. Build Quality the build quality is above par with any phones in this range and can be compared with phones in the premium range (30k to 40k). excellent grip and slim body makes it good to hold and talk. Connectivity the first 4G phone in this price range and excellent download speeds.if you have good connectivity, videos stream effortlessly and there is no buffering whatsoever. Memory with an on board memory of 16 GB and an expandable memory of 128 GB you will never fall short of space for your videos and audio files. Music The boom sound experience cannot be explained, it has to be experienced and trust me, it's MIND BLOWING. Watching movies and listening to music is awesome  and it takes entertainment to a whole new level. CALLs in call voice clarity is amazing and you won't feel the need to put your ear-piece on top volume to get the best clarity out of it, unless you want people to listen to your conversations;-) all in all, this is the best phone that your money can buy in this price range and even if you have a higher budget, trust me don't spend your bucks on any other phone, as the features that you may get in a phone worth 30-35k are all in here. so why do you want to spend extra? if you show this off to your friends you friends would have their jaws dropped after you disclose the pricing. HTC HAS REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WITH THIS MASTERPIECE. WORTH A BUY SURELY!!!!
271	Harshit	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	grt phn....	:)
272	nb	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	Decent phone	The Phone is a pretty decent one  Pros  Good display despite low resolution Excellent speakers ..they are really loud and of high clarity Good processor and future proof( as described by HTC) No lags or performance drops Good design especially the accent colours  Cons  Poor battery backup( about 10 hours with heavy usage and maximum a day) May heat up slightly on gaming...reduced after update Back is a finger print magnet Nano sim( difficult to get )  Overall I would recommend this phone because of it's hardware and chance of future updates as well as its value for price.
273	ARCHI	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	nyc phone	xcellnt perfrmnce... not facing any problem till now... no heatng issues... wch was a major probm regrdng dis ph..
274	Peadyumn rao	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	Nice product,the htc usb chord missing	The product works absolutely fine is a value for money product.it is nice android phone and compact with great features. The 13 mp primary camera,and 8mp front camera is quite clear. snapdeal delivered the product but the usb sync chord was missing in the box, i dont know how is that possible but still they provided assistance and awarded me With 200 rupees of sd cash to purchase a sync chord online from there site. I hope they should not repeat such a glitch in future again.

278	Prasad	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	No one can beat HTC,	Yes I mean it, No one can beat HTC with the build quality, hardware, software and all those features. Although Samsung is having major share they are no where near HTC in quality and addon software HTC sense 6.0.  Snapdragon octacore at this price is awesome.  Thanks HTC for this 820
279	karthick.ramachandran85	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	My First Smart Phone	my family very much excited this phone.
280	Philip Raj	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	Average, Ordinary	Its getting very hot while using camera, browsing & Games. Other than heating problem performance is very good.

284	Pk	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	Just Awesome.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.	Everything is stunning in this Price Band......just go for it!!!! Never go for other option if you are going to spend 25000/-  only thing that pinches me a bit is that there is no option to lock your sim cards or SD card............which can be a problem for you if u are in habit of forgetting your mobile at anywhere!!!
285	Govinda Revanwar	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	Great Phone with Affordable Price	I brought the HTC desire 820 and its really great phone.  PRO: Camera : Front anf Rear both are good in day and normal light condition Display : Not so great but good enough. Speed and Lag: I am using this phone from past few days but i never faced any speed and lag issue in heavy as well as long term use. Battery: I heard from lots of people the battery is not enough but if WiFi is on for full day and normal calls, games then it last for full day.  Con: Phone gets heated for long calls and heavy usage (Games watching Videos). Actually this is not so bad but need to consider that why i am rating 4 Start
286	DINO	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	HTC DESIRE 820	It's too good and amazing experience with htc desire 820
287	daya.0587	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	great phone	Awesome phone gud battery,gud camera,everything is gud .only problem snapdeal will take atleast 6 days for deliver phone.
288	VANDAN	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone !	Gr8 phone and gud service by snapdeal...Satisfied !!
289	Golu	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	Not good enough according to the price..	The look and feel of the mobile is very nice. Only for that I have rated 3 star. But the manufacture is very sad. If the phone can't be dismantled, then there should be some provision to  guard the phone from water. Just 5 sec dip in the water ruined the mother board and gave me a 8000 bucks expenditure. If you buy the phone then handle it with very well care as the phone is very delicate. Such a big phone can't be kept in cotton. Little bit tough it should had been which it isn't at all.
290	sudhanva Hebbar	Jan 12, 2015	Yes	HTC DESIRE 820	PROS:- EXCELLENT CAMERA CLARITY        SOUNDS ARE GOOD AND LOUD        OCTA CORE POROCESSOR GOOD SPEED  CONS :- Didnt get the needy offer, RELIANCE 6 MONTHS 1GB DATA,,,,,, the product box ix a damaged one........... and also the mobile battery sucks
291	Simranjeet Singh	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	Not Good	Got used product. Battery backup was zero. Don't buy anything from snapdeal.
292	Dinesh the Racer	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	Delivered very poor product	I bought an HTC Desire 820 and it was not good condition. Also, It was not working well. I raised a request to replace the same. But, still no one collect it and do me the needful.
293	Riyas	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	perfect	I like this very much
294	Vaishali D. Abhang	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Brilliant Mobile from HTC again i loved this phone as it has all the function and great battery life  It's camera clarity is also brilliant and from camera is too good yaar it has 5 mp camera which will gives  you a wonderful selfy i will suggest this phone is too good than samsung one
295	Rahul	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	Stunner,Beast,Monster......Everything.	I ordered the HTC Desire 820 from Snapdeal on 4th January,2015 for my father and got the order on 6th. Now let me tell you about the product and delivery in detail:-  1) Delivery - The delivery was awesome and very fast. Hats off to Snapdeal. I give it 10/10  2.) Packaging - When we got the phone it was packed in a loose type of cardboard box without packing tape and  the outside packaging too was not ok. I give it 5/10   Now about the phone.....:-  1.) The famous "BOOMSOUND" speakers - It was quite loud and crisp and also created a nice surround sound effect and it's speaker are better than my Ipad 4 , Xiaomi mi 3 and Samsung Galaxy S5 ( Obviously ). But.... I expected more from it but I am truly satisfied. 9/10  2.) Heating issue - This phone heats like hell !....Just joking it doesn't heat up at all ! and some people say that on normal usage it gets heated up. NO ! that is not true at all ! I played games on it while it was charging and there was no heating except it was quite warm but you can't feel that warmth unless you intentionally try to feel it. But dude ! which phone doesn't get warm while charging! My Samsung GS 5 when i use it while charging gets heated like a piece of hrll ! and also the xiaomi also get heated on normal browsing while charging and don't even talk about ipad -_-. Everybody said that ipad 3 heats because it's processor was not placed correctly but ! my friend has it and -_- It is cool as a cucumber  always and instead my ipad 4 heats up a lot more than ipad 3. Just go for the HTC Desire 820. Because I didn't feel anything wrong about the HTC Desire 820.(Just go for it)  3.) Battery - It has a very nice battery backup but i wouldn't say great because it is great for an avg. user and very nice for a heavy user. It is nice for me ;) 9/10  4.) Software/Performance - It comes with Android 4.4.4(KitKat) and Htc Sense UI 6.0 and also it will get the Android L. And FYI the HTC desire is currently using a 32 bit processor because Android kitkat is not so heavy and when the android l update comes it will run 64-bit processor.Now for the performance. The HTC Desire 820 run as smooth as a butter and no lag at all !!!!! It supports dual sim and it also supports microsd card expansion and 4g LTE. It has smooth UI and it doesn't lag at all ! 10/10  5.) Screen - Although it has a 720 p HD display It appears far more crisp and clear than my samsung gs 5. 10/10
296	Ankitwalia	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	Awsome phone	nice features..fast and smooth even in memory eating processes and heavy games. doesn't lag at all. You might get manufacturing fault as i got and Snapdeal doesn't cover it in its policy..so you have to go to the HTC service center which really sucks.but m happy with the overall performance of the phone. :)
297	Vivek Gupta	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	Average, Ordinary	Lovely Phone..Enjoying every bit of it..But I am having issues with the heating and the battery life..The battery life is sad..So that took out two stars..
298	ADITYA GUPTA	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Hi, Pros:  1.Good design,light weight,Slim. 2.Awesome processing,high speed with multiple apps. 3.Astonishing sound quality.  cons: 1.Once s/w got crashed as i used blue-tooth for a long time went the service center they fixed it n he told me about the issue. 2. lil bit heat up on high use of games not that much heated as compare to Sony. 3. Battery life is moderate I used to charge it on morning 2-3 hrs every day it is suffice with moderate use n for high use need charging with in 10-15 hrs.
299	Wang	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	One of the best smart phone.	Amazing phone .
300	gagan	Jan 09, 2015	Yes	perfect	niceThis is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it
301	sanjeev chandawar	Jan 03, 2015	No	Excellent phone to buy	After recent system update in last week battery backup increased by 50%, heating problen reduecd, Phone camera is Good only, Sound is excellent, Phone never hang,Basic phone softeware like contacts, SMS, shortscut, keypad can improve,  i am using since since month,
302	prashant saini	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	good phone...worth purchasing	All features are good..really worth purchasing...  Unexpectedly 3 resets caused anxiety but now it's functioning well..  Would recommend to all
303	Nimu	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	5	camera,video,mindbloing........good performance
304	Kishan	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	Awesome	Awesome phone...  bt the battery drains out very fast while using 3g or wifi...
305	Shashank	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	Absolutely go for it !!!	Just brilliant. First of all, beautiful design. The phone looks very good. Very slim to hold, and comfortable to operate.  Well, its a HTC, what do you expect. They make only beautiful phones.   Processor is very fast, and there are no lags in usages. Transferring data from my old HTC one X to new phone was a 10min job, thanks to HTC transfer tool.  With ordinary usages, Always connection to Wifi + occasional switching to 3G, I am getting a battery backup of more than 1.5 days at least.  Back 13MP camera performs exceptional with daylight, but the low light capture is not that great. Front cam @ 8MP is awesome.  Sound from speakers is very good (do not compare to HTC ONE E8 or M8), and headphones with boom audio is simply awesome.   Now, if you look at the specs at this price (sub 23K), its a nobrainer. Just for this.
306	AKASH RATHI	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	good product	Nice product. ...i have good experience
307	Nikhill	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	Best Phone till today in budget of 22000	Camera par excellent front is 8 mps and back is 13Mps, auto capture mode in front takes 4 differnt color photos it is awesome. Processor: is 1.5ghz with 8 core Qualcomm... Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)   processer speed is good but when we are trying for multitasking with games or heavy ram killer apps phone heats up.chargung time also is aproblem it will take more than 5 hours to charge hahah then five hours back up. Sound quality is good. But the bundilled speakers are of old model .this phone is good for pepole with extra large hand .one hand opperation is quit impossible  Also battery issues do to heavy ram usage is too but in price os 20k its excellent ...........but i guess this battery problem shall be solved with Lollypop update.... so waiting for lolly pop update fr my HTC  820
308	sanjay sardar	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	good choice to htc desire 820	1st thanks to snapdeal for great delivery service. Now comes to Mobile, this is fully recommended from my side to all customer who are planning to purchase a mid range phone..I have purchased it 11 days ago.I like this phone very much even i started to love this .Best things are 1-> Battery :- 2600 mAH , its giving one and half day backup after full usage of this phone.Playing game, doing net but still giving one and half day backup. here 5 out of 5 2-> Camera :- WAW , 13 MP primary and 8 MP secondary, what a combination ...filled all the expectation.Pictures are crystal clear and very very nice. Secondary is idle to take selfie , even this also take nice pictures. also 6(six) out of 5 3-> Display :- i personally love large display and this is great.No words for it. 5 out of 5 4-> Touch & Performance :- very sensitive, working properly , no issue about performance.All clear.  i have some disappointment 1-> Memory :- When i play game the phone well b heated just lik microowen.
309	Mayur Jayantilal Bhavsar	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Awesome phone. I have not much discovered all features, still I feel its good to have
310	Gautam	Jan 03, 2015	Yes	Overpriced and major battery issue	I bought htc 820 in November-14 with high hopes.Overall the phone is average and has major battery issue.The battery drains fast on normal usage and even after activating inbuilt power saver mode.I very much feel that the phone is overpriced and feel let down after using it for a month.
311	Gupta	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	perfect	Good Price
312	Denish Vachhani	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	It's Cool Mobile! Super Fast!, Awesom Look and good bettery backup.   cons: Sometime there is heating problem while with heavy usage
313	Ravindra	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	HTC 820 very good phone	HTC 820 is very good phone, it has good options like good processor, good camera with front and back and gorilla glass finishes, wide screen as 5.5 inch, expandable memory up to 128 GB.Over all we will satisfy this phone with features available, don't compare Chinese phone XIOMI, the quality is extremely good. The only draw back is the phone is heating after playing games and connected to wifi. After receiving the phone, don't try to install software by ourself, it will be locked. consult good service centers to install softwares.
314	Shubham Goswami	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	That's Good Stuff	nyc phone.....nyc design....very much fond of it.....
315	jaswant singh	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	That's Good Stuff	I bought it for my brother and he absolutely loved it.Barring the color, everything about it great
316	Shashank	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	Very very disappointed from Snapdeal	these five stars only belongs to the HTC Desire 820 which is a very nice phone with good specs with a affordable price.  i have done research on this phone before buying and my findings help me take good decision on buying this according to my daily usage. i'm very impressed from this phone. BUT.. i'm very disappointed from Snapdeal services and the delay in delivery and then delivering the wrong HTC Model. They don't have any coordination between the seller and the courier company. they are absent minded because they have send me the bill of the right product with the wrong product.  Snapdeal have been a huge success in E-commerce but still their coordination problem will become a major threat in future. I advice Snapdeal to keep a close check on their sellers and the courier company because if they make any mistake the ultimate sufferer is the Customers only.
317	Guhan	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	Perfect	Perfect. It doesn't get any better
318	manish	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	Htc Desire 820 Best smart phone.	i bought this last week. i feel this is the best buy for this cost considering the features.the screen is good. Speaker Sound Quality is good.. I am just loving it...... it is simply the best phone @ this price range....!! working smoothly...good camera quality good. battery backup.....no heating problem as somebody complaint and i am completely happy with the service of snapdeal... Overall its a pretty good phone..
319	Gaurav	Dec 26, 2014	Yes	High End beauty at affordable price	First let me start this review by saying - this is my 4th HTC in a row. So it makes me slightly biased with HTC phones, but all for good reasons.   Now after using this phone for about 10 days, let me say, this is the best phone you can buy in 20-22 k range. (I baught it for 21,587/- from Snapdeal).   Before ordering I had only one concern - I hear too much of criticism for overheating, Thankfully, this criticism is not completely true. That said I'm not a big time gamer or geek. I would spend most of my time on mobile with Temple Run, Subway Surfer, Candy Crush. Whatsapp, email and online browsing included. + I also make n receive calls :)   Below is what I found the good, the bad n the ugly with this phone :   Let's start with The GOOD  1. Call Quality : Sometimes I think, isn't it the most important yet ignored feature of smart phones : Call Quality. well, this phone offers excellent quality on this parameter.  2. Looks : Awesome looks, slightly over sized and at times needs both hands to operate. best thing is - even though it's plastic - it does not look cheap at all. design is fabulous with blue highlights gives an altogether different feel.   3. Sense UI : I've always been a fan of HTC Sense UI and this one is spot on again. just luv it.   4. Boomsound : I'm not sure if any other mobile can ever compete with the sound quality that HTC offers.   5. Camera : well, I won't say it's the best camera, but definitely it's not bad at all. yeah, there are many camera features that I haven't tried yet...maybe in time to come. but yeah, front camera is well above average if not the best.   6. RAM \ Processor : 2 GB RAM with 1.5Ghz + 1.0 Ghz quad processors let you run as many applications you want at the same time without a single lag. I mean, performance wise, this one is the smoothest of all HTCs I've used till date. Being the first 64 bit processor helps as well.  7. SD Card : 128 GB expendable memory with 16 GB in built. This is just wonderful. I'm not sure if I need to explain this. (you get around 10 GB of in built memory)   8 Dual SIM : it's a very good feature keeping in mind I need two numbers. one for official use and other for personal.   with enough of GOOD, there are few BAD   1. Battery : 2600 mAH. not the best we expect for a phone so rich with features. but it take you through the day with no major issues. there are power saver options, but again as someone pointed out - we shouldn't need them.   2. In built music player : One word : it sucks. better download Poweramp or some other music player to enjoy the best quality sound.   3. Plastic Build : as mentioned above, it doesn't look cheap at all. But I'd have loved the metallic finish. But again, for that few extra bucks needed (HTC One) :P   4. Over Size : for me it's kind of a disadvantage. I guess, 5" or maybe 5.2" would have been sufficient.   5: Display : it's not a FHD display n PPI is also less as compared to few other devices. That said, even on 5.5" screen display is very good, colors look natural and bright.   6. Overheating : It hadn't been a big issue for me and Thank God for that. But, for all those heavy gamers, it could be an issue.   now let's move to the worst thing. The UGLY :   1. what waste of a headset you provided with such a beauty. it was a let down. specially considering with my last HTC I got beats headphones, it at least they could have offered proper in ear headphones.   Last word : If you want a quality phone with high end specs good looks, If brand value holds water for you and you can slightly compromise on battery - Go For It.   Thanks for reading!!  Gaurav

325	kumar	Dec 23, 2014	Yes	Beast in its class	Superb design. Nice camera.13 mp is awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeee. 2gb ram nd octacore gives best of it. 64bit, octacore processor,4g connectivity,gg3..boom speakers. this hardware configuration will take atleast 1year to get outdated in market only concern is its battery,, it could have been better.Still the battery is good. As a whole its a classic one. I am using this phone 20 days.Most of my friends are jealous of my phone who have bought other phones in the same price range as desire 820 dominates all

330	khan	Dec 23, 2014	Yes	its awsome	From grand to this migration... Design looks performance both cameras awesome A bit poor battery release go and grab it.
331	Huzaifa Ghadiali	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	That's Good Stuff	I got this phone before a week, and after a week of daily heavy usage, I feel everything is as awesome as marketed and specified, except for the biggest cons or disadvantage is -  battery backup which is almost average or below average due to the provided 2600Mah battery for heavy data and gaming users, but should take you comfortably till the end of  the day for moderate  usage.  Second is the email utility other than the proprietary gmail app, which does not have a full-fledged unified mailbox. Its pretty tricky to get used to.  Also the screen resolution is pretty low compared to other flagship devices, but that is not much of a issue, unless you are a movie freak or totally rely on 5.5" for all your display needs.   Nevertheless best points are -  4G on both sims,  octa core snapdragon 615,  lolipop update assured,  128GB external memory card and  8MP front camera - selfie perfect  These reasons are high enough to make it a worthy buy & which makes it truly a future oriented device.
332	Ramo	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	Good android device  at this price range	Initially I was afraid  of  shopping  through  this site because  of some bad experiences published on news and social  media . But finally  I have decided to take a chance and now I am happy to shop through  this site. Service is very good and reliable. Product is very good . I would  shop more an more ...again and again through  your site .
333	krishna	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	nice phone...good camera	everything working gud in this phone
334	SSK	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	Awesome phone	This Is my second andriod mobile, and I liked this mobile very much, camera quality and headphone quality is very nice.  But Phone ringing sound is very low :(
335	VK	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	Not good	I received the handset on 13 Dec'14 and after 4 days i.e. on 17 Dec the handset started giving problems. It got hanged and just keeps going on & off.
336	prakash	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	very well done.	good offer & fast delivery
337	Rajesh	Dec 18, 2014	Yes	Great and amazing phone	I have been using so called iconic phones so far including IPhone 5. This phone is really good one in features, looks, sturdiness and camera. 4G in both SIM slots is a major plus point. Screen though has less PPI, looks vibrant. Good points: 1. 5.5 in is big but easy to handle. Once used to it then other phones looks not cool. 2. Brightness of the phone is good. I used it in sun light and easy to read the text. 3. Controls like power button and volume are easy to reach and easy to operate. 4. Boom sound is the best. However when we receive calls, the sound is routed through front boom speakers and takes some time to get used to it. 5. Front camera being 8MP is wow for selfies. Got additional settings like face contour, booth, skin smoothening etc. 6.Rear camera is good at 13MP. 7. 128GB external memory should be more than requirement for anyone I suppose. 8. Octa core processor by Snapdragon needs 64 bit OS. HTC tweet says Lolipop would be rolled soon. 9. No lags though I don't play games. More than synthetic benchmarks I feel phone is zippier. 10. Sense UI is very fast and not irritating like Touchwiz of Samsung and also doesn't have too many apps like Sony which can't be removed. 11. Light weight and good build quality. 12. HTC online service is amazing. 13. Once used to HTC then difficult to switch over I think. This is my first HTC phone.  Cons: 1. SIMS are nano. So need to go to service providers to get SIMS.  2. Battery lasts less than a day. Evening needs recharge. 3. Battery recharge is very slow. Takes nearly 5 Hrs. 4. Single LED flash. 5. Less screen resolution and no 1020 HD screen. 6. No NFC.  Verdict: At 22K, this phone is the best smart phone. Go for it.

342	James_hems	Dec 12, 2014	No	Overall great phone in this range	The htc desire 820 is the best phone available in the market of mid-range smartphones. The performance is pretty good,looks premium and a nice camera on both ends.  What makes HTC Desire 820 unique? # The world's first smartphone to be powered by a 64-bit octa-core processor # The thinnest HTC phone # The phone priced around Rs. 22,000 with the highest camera resolution # The most high-end Dual SIM Phablet  For- # Stunning 64 bit Octa Core processor(better suited for andriod L) # Great cameras (both front and rear) # Multiple color options (white,grey) # Excellent audio experience (dual-front boomsound speakers) # High-end connectivity features  As such it has very few cons.  For me - # size 5.5in big screen with relatively less resolution   (247 ppi) # Non-removable battery (only 2600 mAh)
343	prashant	Dec 12, 2014	Yes	Very Nice	Its a nice phone

346	Hanu	Dec 12, 2014	No	THIS PHONE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE OCTA CORE	In the specifications it is mentioned as quad core, but desire 820 is supposed to have octa core. Someone please help!
347	Dhiren	Dec 12, 2014	Yes	perfect phone	good phone awesome camera clearity and stunning 1080p hd video clarity
348	sanjay jain	Dec 12, 2014	Yes	HTC DESIRE 820	Really smart one having all features of a costly mobile phone. Light waight, smart look with very fast processor and memory expandable upto 128 GB makes this awonderful phone in this price range.
349	Divyesh	Dec 12, 2014	Yes	Perfect	ALL IN ONE
350	deepak csunny	Dec 12, 2014	Yes	HTC desire 820	Product was good till i got my new nanao sim.i am using 3g network and the battery get drains with in 5hrs of moderate use .camera is superb nearly good as DSLR with fullfunction .display could have been better.screen is afinger print mangnet .dont expect magic from this mibile its a all in one phone with reasonable price .processer speed is good but when we are trying for multitasking with games or heavy ram killer apps phone heats up.chargung time also is aproblem it will take more than 5 hours to charge hahah then five hours back up. Sound quality is good. But the bundilled speakers are of old model .this phone is good for pepole with extra lage hand .one hand opperation is quit impossible .
351	Prince Mittal	Nov 24, 2014	No	battery back up	i bought it 3 days back. everything is good but battery backup is very bad. if you want battery back up then dont buy it.
352	rakesh	Nov 24, 2014	Yes	masterpiece at reasonable price	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
353	ram	Nov 24, 2014	No	Good Mobile . Just for it	Good Mobile . Just for it
