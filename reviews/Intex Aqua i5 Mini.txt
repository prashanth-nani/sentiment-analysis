4	Arka	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	nice phone with these specs	everything is nice but ROM is 1.72 GB not 4GB and app storage is still less and it cant be upgraded as intex has no intention to do. I think one should go for android one phone if he dont want 8MP phone in these price And ofcourse it is indian brand and money you spend will be in india only. It also has pre installed iOS UI But it have very poor battery life
