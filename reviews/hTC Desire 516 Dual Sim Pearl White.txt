18	excellent	Sep 08, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

107	ImranKhan	Mar 04, 2015	Yes	Good phone at a reasonable price.	Bought this phone to my mom and she likes it. The last HTC phone I'd used was wildfire and htc was expensive then in 2009. Desire 516 is good phone to normal usage. Loved the charger provided as it charges the battery to full in about an hour. I'm using the same charger for my note 2. The phone does not freeze for normal usage. Did not notice any heating issues.and the battery back up is decent too.HTC phones are good looking, unlike Samsung which look plasticy and cheap. The build quality of desire 516 is very nice and sturdy. I liked the phone although haven't put it to test with heavy apps. video calls what's app and similar applications work normally. Camera quality is decent. This phone is worth the money.  I got a free flip cover which normally costs about 500-800 rupees. In short I'm satisfied with the Purchase and would recommend it at the current price.
108	Bhagavan	Mar 04, 2015	Yes	not satisfied	if u r a HTC lover, then only u buy this phone. Otherwise it waste of money. poor camera quality.  product delivered 5 days after the order placed.So not a bad delivery.

121	Mukesh Mishra	Jan 23, 2015	No	Planning For New Cell phone	Hey Every one! I would like to inform you about HTC Desire 516 4Gb  i am planning to change my old phone  The HTC Desire 516 sports a 5-inch LCD 540 x 960 pixels multi-touch display with 220 ppi pixels density. Encased in a classic full black colored body, it weighs around 173g and has a 9.7mm thick body. The HTC Desire 516 operates on Android v4.2 Jelly Bean platform with HTC's Sense UI on top.  Processor and RAM  The HTC smartphone is equipped with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor which is clocked at a speed of 1.2GHz. The onboard memory (RAM) is 1GB which further aids to the processor speed and performance.   Camera and Storage  The handset is packed with dual cameras; 5MP rear camera and 2MP front facing camera. Like every other HTC phone, even this phone quirks with camera quality. Even though the resolutions are less, they offer good quality videos and photos. The device comes with ample storage memory which is further expandable via microSD slot.   Connectivity and others  For staying connected with other devices, the HTC phone features Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB port, 3G etc. It is fuelled by a 1,950mAh battery, which claims to offer 9 hours of talktime and 220 hours of standby time on 3G networks.  Verdict This 5-incher falls under the mid-range phablet category yet packed with impressive features like a powerful processor and decent cameras. The device lacks an HD display but still renders great visuals. Great option if you are looking for a budget phablet with a good brand value.

186	Parth	Nov 17, 2014	Yes	excellent and good stuff ever .	Good services always. Snapdeal site is the also the best and popular site too .There service and review are also good about my htc it is excellent in condition  I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
