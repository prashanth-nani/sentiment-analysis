2	Suzuki91	Mar 18, 2016	Yes	Intex ultra 3000	Ok this is a decent phone in this price but you would expect more anyways pros cons goes like this Pros No. 1 battery of course the real deal for which you bought it. 3000 mah big battery. It would take sometimes more than 4 hours to charge completely. And lasted for 11 days according to me with a normal use. No. 2 The good looks and design. 3. The torch  The CONs 1. Sissy  Earphones  2. Charger is like slight better than chinese product but not like samsung ones I use my samsung charger to charge it. 3. No basic browser  4. Not a single MB internal space. You can store limited amount of texts But i bought it becuz of the back up it gives and quite satisfied with that. For other things i have a smartphone.
