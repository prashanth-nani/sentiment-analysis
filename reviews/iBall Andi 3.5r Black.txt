1	Rks	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Don't judge a phone by its Brand	I know iball doesn't have much value in market than samsung and other competitior but some model of some new brand are successful. My this Andi 3.5r Black was one of them Great features and very Durable im using it till now without any damage.... You can buy this product from iball....that is what i can say Thanks for reading this
2	enzee	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Not Bad Stuff	The phone is not bad at all considering its price. It is working almost perfectly well. Light, easy to use design is smart. Yet, memory is a little bit too low and I have some problem while typing, i.e.. very easy to make typing mistakes and the phone can hardly be used properly while charging. Anyway, at this price range, the product is a good one. If you have a small money and wanted to buy a smartphone, this is one of the phones you have to buy...
3	KK	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Worth the money	Pretty look, clear display n easy controls, camera is fine but video recording resolution is small, headphone can be improved, light weight handset which is easy to carry n use.

11	Puneet	Dec 06, 2013	Yes	best as enough in this price	this phone having enough quality accordingly to price...not much will we got in any other brand...all android phone have mostly got a problem of battery backup...this phone takes 1.30-2.00 hours to charge and standby time is too short we could not use any process longer..this not for gaming the lowest version of subway surfer automatically stop by oc also not running temple run ....sound is clear but not much louder!! sound is much low... and the hands-free not give enough bass or sound quality but as my view the phone is economic and we got enough quality in this price...phone does not have a flash could made it so perfect..5mp camera needs a flash it is use less in the night!!...... one battery should be free with it and i miss flash light with 5mp camera!!
