1	nil	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	working memory 14.9 Gb	Delivery is good. Working memory is 14.9 Gb. Data transfer speed is good
2	greatsouvik	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	More than average	Phone is overall good. But rear camera is not too perfect and battery cell got drained quickly.
3	Abdul Subhan	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	Mobile is superb. Battery back up I hate it.	Mobile is superb. Battery back up I hate it. Overall I can use it for 7 to 8 hrs with mild usage. Not worth paying for the performance. Not even 4G, after I purchased this product, so many other 4G mobiles launched around similar pricing. Buyer need not have to worry on spending additional amount for screen guard n flip cover. Because they come default in the box. Anyways as per me, Intex is a good brand, but the Research and Development is not enough before launching the product in the market. If this mobile comes with 4G n 3650mah battery for Rs.8K, definitely this will rock in the market.
4	Wandame	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	Awesome mobile	Perfect product from Snapdeal, worth of money and plus arrival on time. Intex Aqua xtreme 2 is perfect for 3G, 2GB ram, 16GB internal memory, fine camera both back and front and battery back up also good with 2000mah. Go for it...
5	sanyam	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	nice product	product is good but shipping service is bad. phone has very good n slim. stylish and do not have hanging problem.
6	Sowmya Venkat	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	Intex Aqua XTREME 2 16GB Silver	This product is really awesome...!!! I'm really satisfied with the product and I recommend this product to my friends also...snap deal doing good...the best custom satisfaction.
7	Babu	Mar 01, 2016	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
