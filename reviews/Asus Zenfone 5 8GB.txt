7	jaswinder singh	Nov 22, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	I recently purchased Asus Zenfone 5 from snap deal , first of all i was very pleased with the service as I recieved it on 5 th day after placing my order, about the smartfone  due to its 2GB ram it enables to access multitasking , browsing internet and playing games at a good speed , also due to its internal memory one can store enough data , its wifi and 3G connectivity is remarkable, its 5 inch screen enables one to see videos , its sleek stylish  look  , gorilla glass (no wear glass), its sound are some of the features that distinguish it from others , so i strongly recommend one to buy this smartfone and experience the magic.
8	amit	Nov 22, 2015	Yes	perfect	It seems like perfect smartphone
9	Sharad	Nov 22, 2015	Yes	Excellent phone	All my friends have bought this phone after they saw it with me. I also bought two, one for my brother and the other for, of course, myself. Now about the phone- forget about the benchmark and everything. It is the feel, convenience and performance that matter at last and this phone is way beyond goid in all of these aspects. Touch is smooth like butter. One can play any kind of game with it. Surfing the web and watching videos on youtube are very smooth without any lag. Camera is excellent outdoor in sunlight; indoors in normal artificial light pics are noisy. Video chat is okay, no video calling feature. Call recording is present. I have used chromecast with the phone and found the combination perfect. Although playing games with chromecast on big screen is bad the screen casting and other chromecadt supporting apps function well.

18	Pranab	Apr 08, 2015	Yes	Good smartphone in tte price range	Purchased this phone from snapdeal months before. After few months of vigorous use below are the my opinion regardein he phone. PROS: Touch-great, Multitasking-good,camera-nice,headphone-nice.Zen UI-user friendly. CONS:Battery- sucks.It hardly lasts for 1- 1:30 hrs of continous Wi-fi+Gaming+chat.Battery heats up a lot while charging.Faced some issues with keyboard after upgradation to 4.4.2, which I solved by downloading 3rd party keyboard. Speakers - veeerrrry poor. Hanged couple of times in 3 months span. Will recommend for buy if you have budget constraint. Snapdeal service-4/5.Purchased the phone under SBI debit card offers. Got the 10% money back only after knocking them once.

Asus team plz rectify the battery issue with an upgrade.
25	d-liner	Feb 20, 2015	Yes	Amazing Phone	This is my second android device.Perfect phone in 8-10 K range.I have been using the phone for 2 months.No issues till now.The main thing i like about this phone is unlike samsung/micromax asus give regular updates for both the applications and os.asus have already promised a lolipop update for zenfones. the main issue i found is battery.the y could have provided a 3000 mAh battery instead of the present one which drains quickly.

32	jas	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	asus zenfone 5 - perfect	Wanted a smart phone. So researched a lot and found Asus zenfone 5. Read the reviews, most of them positive, some negative. Most negative reviews were regarding low battery life. I ordered it and was sceptical regarding the battery life, but it has held up well and I end the day with about 40-50% battery left. The features are great for the price. The screen is the best ever, comparable to iphone. The camera great. I am loving it. What's more, I did not want a phone which I could see in every second person's hand. I its unique after all it's the zenfone :)
33	citu	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	extraordinary	It is the best mobile I ever used.battery backup is excellent and very nice looking.not even a single complent in this handset.I would like to be used by my friendcircle and relatives also use this mobile.

37	Anup	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Review post using one month	Updated to Kitkat immediately... initially had problem with video recording, service center changed the sub board. Till date working fine, no issues at all. Value for money, Asus has good brand value since many years in IT hardware sector.

39	Manish	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Good product but camera is not good	Camera is not good
40	Inti	Jan 22, 2015	No	Awesome Zenny!	Zenfone 5 aka Zenny (thats what its fan club calls it) is a beautifully crafted phone, slightly curved at the rear with matte finish (feels premium) and the concentric circles below at front adds to its style. It has 2GB Ram which was first in this price range. Runs on Intel's processor which offers lag free performance, initially I was skeptical since Intel based handheld devices never performed that well and I heard about battery issues but there were no lags and after the last update battery last almost a day easily. The best thing is the Camera, It takes really nice pictures and comes with Pixel mater technology plus has multiple effects settings. My brother is using the 8GB version for about 5 months now. here are the pros and Cons Pros 1) 8MP auto focus Camera with multiple effect settings. 2) Bright,clear 5inch HD display. 3) 1.6 Ghz Intel Dual core processor. 4) 2GB RAM 5) Dual Sim GSM+GSM 6) 2100MAh battery 7) Sensitive touchscreen, has glove mode as well.  Cons- 1) After the updates battery is good so no cons as such. 2) there is a slight gap between the screen and the body at the right side near the concentric circles, very little may be in the batch my brother is using but nothing to worry about.
41	pb	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Poor Battery back up, Excellent handset	Poor Battery back up, Excellent handset. I would recommend  any one to buy it with good luck of getting a good battery inside.
42	sundari	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	ZENFONE 5 ==> EXECELLENT	This is my 2nd Andriod mobile. The mobile performace is execellent. but when the mobile is used more than 1 hour for gaming, little bit heat in battery side & battery is drain soon. That too accepted because of high resolution of screen. Till now I haven't face hanging of my mob. All the system application and entire mobile is superb. Simply It is execellent.  Battery, front/back camera, performance, speed, and etc., everything is fast, fast, fast.....

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.also bye this phone  my fends.  By imran maknojiya  from palanpur gujarat
46	Cool Mint	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Excellent product in 10k price range	BODY : looks sleek, easy to use by one hand as well. Bezel is sleek, though overall thickness is close to 9mm. This adds to the style. Weight : 145 g, optimum for 5 inch phone SIM : Dual SIM which is excellent to have office/personal sims both DISPLAY : 5.0 inches at ~294 ppi pixel density, good with Multitouch, Corning Gorilla Glass 3 memory : 8 GB with 2GB RAM adding to the performance & support for ext MEMORY Card slot is great. CAMERA Primary : 8 MP, however performance of camera is just at par or below par  Secondary 2 MP, is let down, pixelation is common  & in low light conditions, performance is not good. Speakers : are just average & loudness is same as well. BATTERY  : Non-removable Li-Po 2110 mAh battery, could have been better 2500 MAH or so  Overall excellent phone except camera & loudspeaker. Zen UI is very responsive & some of the ASUS programs add to the productivity.

57	Jinkoo	Jan 01, 2015	Yes	EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE	Pros: 1. As a senior citizen with diminished hearing, I found the loud and clear rendering of calls received a real plus. 2. Equally, the screen and quality of display are very good, once the brightness is stepped up (unfortunately at the cost of battery life!). 3. Quality of images from the camera are great, specially in low light conditions. The enhancements for tweaking the photos are another plus for those who would like to play around with their photos. 4. As a package, it offers excellent value for money. Cons: 1. Battery life is not upto the mark 2. Speaker Volume and Notifications sound levels could be improved.

Phone just hangs & get switched off during calls sometimes & don't  get network after switching it on for 2-3 mins and if someone calls at that particular time the/she can hear the ringing but the can't even see any incoming callneither on screen nor in the call log which is really annoying.

90	Saurabh	Dec 13, 2014	Yes	great simply great	there were quite many budget smartphone's available when i brought this one but have to say i did made the right choice. this phone is much better than redme note and moto g 2nd gen since i have used all the devices mentioned. the atom processor to my surprise is really fast and its dual core with hyper threading which means its actually better than quad core. but the greatest thing about this device is its design you wont be disappointed by it. just Google its reviews and you will find that its design has even stumbled the experts. and FYI it comes pre rooted which is a must for us developers out their.
91	sans	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	nice phone under 10000	everything is fine but the battery should be of higher mah.
92	raj	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	good	Nice and very good mobile. Nice look.good camera nice picture quality. Also 2 gb ram at this cost is good.
93	Darshan	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	Value for Money	The mobile is gud, i just loved it.. the battery life is little low and front camera is not up to the mark rest are awesome..  But the delivery time is toooooooooo long. Snapdeal should improve that.
94	Bhaskar Kashyap	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	Marvellous	Performance at its best!
95	Shankha	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	Product is good though some minor issues	There is some issue with making calls. If the call is not connected or after disconnecting the call sometimes it behaves unexpectedly. Though it does not hamper any other running apps or processes. Camera - after you click, it takes a bit more time to capture the photo compared to others. Battery back up is not bad but can be improved.
96	Prasad	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	I have use so many Android phones but this one is amazing...... ZenUi Technology is really awesome.
97	shaan	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	Excellent Product	Its a budget phone and the delivery services is also excellent
98	ROMEDRA PAL RAYAT	Dec 05, 2014	No	Best of the best product	I an great admirer of this product, and off course of ASUS since its desktop days. A technology giant, which never failed its customer is back with beautiful product Zen phone, after desktop PC, laptop, notebook, tablet. Above all a great combination of Intel  processor with ASUS who know how to arrange all the component on a tiny motherboard. It is the best combination of Intel processor, Intel Modem, light weight, very good front and back camera, 2 GB ram, more than 2000 mha battery, 5 inch screen with corning gorilla glass, best Zen UI, pixel master camera software, android 4.4.2 (which is to be updated through OTA, if not default with product), Promise to give android Lollipop in April 2015,Frequent update even for small bug, very fast, what else I should say, I purchased second set for my BOSS, after fully satisfying myself with this set. Audio quality is at its best, both SIM 3G enable. Pros :-  For brand ASUS, which is highly realable,Intel Processor, Intel Modem, High quality signal antenna, Good quality Camera, 2 GB ram. Pixel master camera software, Award winning Zen User interface, Light weight, No lag on any game, More than 2100 MB ram always with more than 100 applications, No lag, what else I say, just have one immediately. Cons:- For this product----NIL Best Uses - It is one best of the best product for any type of use.
99	Balram	Dec 05, 2014	Yes	Aswesome Phone	Very Good Phone in this price, fast and perfect

101	Guni	Nov 23, 2014	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	VERY GOOD
102	Pankaj	Nov 23, 2014	No	A complete value for your money.	Though I was bit confused when I somehow listened to my inner voice and bought ASUS Zenfone 5, but after using it for nearly one month, I can safely bet that it is nearly unmatchable at this cost. It matches the features and performance of 20 K+ mobiles.  Key Features of Asus Zenfone 5: â€¢2 GB RAM â€¢Powerful Corning Gorilla Glass 3 â€¢Android v4.3 (Jelly Bean) Upgradeable to v4.4 (KitKat) OS â€¢Expandable Storage Capacity of 64 GB â€¢8 MP Pixel Master Camera with Auto Focus â€¢Intel Atom Processor with Hyper-Threading Technology â€¢5-inch Capacitive Touchscreen This phone gives lag free performance. Gaming is also giving good experience even with heavy games like Asphalt 8. The only small issue is Battery life which however is manageable with efficient usage.  Just go and buy it. Best buy.
