1	mrupam5	Mar 25, 2016	Yes	Good product but wrong information	HTC 626 dual SIM is a very good mobile. Advantages The best part of this mobile is its looks with nice sober blue colour. The product was delivered before three days.   Disadvantages  The biggest disadvantages of this mobile is that it is not android 5.0 lollipop version as mentioned by snapdeal website. It is a kit Kat 4.4 mobile. The information given of the snapdeal website is wrong so beware. According to snapdeal website,it is having gorilla glass 3 protection on its screen. But this is also a false information.You will not get any type of screen protection.
