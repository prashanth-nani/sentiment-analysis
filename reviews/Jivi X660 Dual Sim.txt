1	omi	Jan 07, 2016	Yes	Good Stuff!!	Display - It's bright and has good color reproduction. Visible under Direct sunlight.    Look & Feel -  feels sturdy and it on a little heavier side but got used to it pretty quickly. Matte finish on the back ensures good grip :)  Connectivity - Dual sim works great , has a FM radio and GPRS net also !!   audio output via 3.5 mm jack is nice and loud .  Speaker is also adequately loud.  Battery life -  battery works great. 2500mAh  mammoth battery  lasts around 4-5 days on a full charge.  conclusion - FM with good good battery life with a awesome price nice work jivi!
