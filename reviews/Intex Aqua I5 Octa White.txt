2	Madhu	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Light weight, Processor & ram speed are very good. Better network. Recharge battery very fast. But Camera quality is not so good like 13 MP. Edges of object in image pixels. Loudness of Speaker is not enough. Overall its a very good OTG supported smartphone.
