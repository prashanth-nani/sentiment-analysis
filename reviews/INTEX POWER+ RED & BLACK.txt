The Intex Power is a great option for carrying out all the basic tasks in a smart fashion without having to think about the battery backup. You can take advantage of the rear VGA camera occasionally while sharing files and folders with the basic connectivity options. Storing a large number of files has been made easier by the large external memory supported by the handset...!!!...
