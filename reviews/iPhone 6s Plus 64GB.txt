1	Pratyay	Jan 13, 2016	Yes	Great product, First Iphone..loving it!	As mentioned being the first time user for Iphone, things were not served onto a plate but already loving the betterness from Andriod. The look and feel is incomparable, excellent battery back up, lasted literally 72hrs after 100% charge. Yes, these reviews are from 3 weeks experience only but this is my 7th or 8th smartphone in hand, so I am saying keeping everything in mind. Better one goes through tips and tricks videos of Iphone 6s plus on youtube to feel the magic better. Reason behind the 4 star is the microphone on the phone is not good, cant judge whether a product fault or faulty product. Having a very hard time listening while talking directly with the phone (no headphones attached). Will once have to check with store. Snapdeal delivery was within scheduled time, so no complains!
