4	Jaggi	Aug 06, 2014	Yes	Value For Money	It is a budget Phone......with almost all Feature Starting from its looks.....it has sleek and cool design... And comes with a Flip cover.....plus its own cover It has android 4.0(ICS)..... it has clear sound and easy to control...... Very Good processor......(1GH) Has a ram of 512mb....which is enough for this Device Rear Camera Quality is Good but not Excellent.....still good enough to capturing memorable moments......Front Camera is Digital.....Which is Not Bad but not even Good..... but Still better than VGA Battery is 1400mAh....which can Stay with u for 3/4 a day......Its a week point of this phone.....but over all.....

8	raj	Aug 06, 2014	No	value for money	karbonn A90 is a budget smart phone with almost all desired features.but 3g is not supported,wifi is supporting.4"capacitive display is super responsive.android 4 ics with 512 mb ram with 1GHZ processor is  enough .5mp camera with flash is enough for capturing memorable moments.secondary digital camera is suitable for video calling by using 3rd party applications.this phone comes with flip covers is an added advantage.
