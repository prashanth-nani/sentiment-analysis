21	SAMI	Oct 07, 2015	Yes	Phone is Very Nice!	Phone is excellent and having no problems yet! all accessories are just perfect bu there are some built issues that it doesn't have any memory slot and no port for any extra sim so they are some issues else the phone is brilliant, screen quality is way better than I phone 6 and Samsung super A.M.O.L.E.D display, The fake call feature seems to be very interesting,  selfies are excellent and with a bumper cover phone looks a luxury, i will recommend all of you if you go for a phone that has good looks, not too many features then you must buy this.. :)
