1	Guest	Mar 17, 2016	Yes	ExcellentProduct	Buying this phone was one of my best decisions. Premium feel, fast performance, terrific camera and what not. Well, the name is enough for you to know that you're not going to waste your money if you buy it. I highly recommend it. I've been using it for almost 10 months and I don't have any issues whatsoever.

I would like to tell you others as apple centre is claiming that after purchasing on web you will not be getting warranty that is wrong they are misleading us to buy from from there showroom .Buying from Snapdeal my iPhone 6 plus gold is having a valid warranty and Valid purchase invoice .  Thanks a ton snapdeal and cheers to your team for efficent delivery .
11	Pratyaksh	Nov 16, 2015	Yes	Amazing product.... Fast delivery	I ordered this phone during the festive season in November (Diwali) and to my surprise I got the product within 3 days(tier 2 city). Thanks to Snapdeal :D  - The packing was good and the product is genuine. The price is easily 5-6 k less than what retail stores are offering. The phone is slim and easy to hold.   - Nice camera quality and cool display. I've used Android phones ranging from Samsung Note to Asus Zenfone 2 but iOS is a different experience altogether.   - The phone comes with iOS 8 and you'll have to update it to iOS 9 yourself.  - Battery life is mind boggling specially if you are an Android user. I am a heavy gamer yet I easily have 30-40 percent battery when I go to sleep.  - Overall it's a great phone to buy and full marks to Snapdeal for the excellent packing and amazingly quick delivery.
12	Aditya Vats	Nov 16, 2015	Yes	Very good in its delivery, phn is also good.	Very good in its delivery, phn is also good, nd seller is best in its class.
13	Jeet	Nov 16, 2015	Yes	iPhone 6 Plus awesome one	Battery too awesome.....................
14	Harish	Nov 16, 2015	Yes	Nice change from android	Got one in original sealed pack from seller though the pack could have been shock proofed better in the outer cardboard. Fast delivery in two days was surprising.  Have been using from two weeks and am happy with it. Recent upgrade to ios 9.1 has been surprisingly great with no bugs or issues as of know. Will list all the pros and cons I felt compared to my android.  Pro s  lag free os  Pretty thin for people who dislike bulky phones.  Camera low light performance is awesome specially if the in phone camera editing app is used.  Some of the Apps from app store really great very intuitive, though not free.  Some of the great functions of android now in ios 9.1  The best battery life I ever experienced. light to moderate use 7 to 8 hrs screen on time.  Speaker quality is satisfactory.  All the google services can be used and is a hassle free transition from android.       Cons  Customizability still android is better. Gets boring sometimes looking at the home screen.  Pretty slippery.  Bezels are big.  Have to get used to not having a back key.  Screen resolution is 1080 p only but good lcd panel.   So overall take an iPhone if you want a change from android but some earlier reasons for change like premium design and materials used might not be relevant now as there are equally great premium designs coming out in android scene.

Its camera is awesome. Sound quality is superb. I have been using 7 mobiles which are of Nokia, Samsung and Asus. But this is something which I am going to love for a long long time. Worth every penny which rolled out of your pockets.

85	Rishi	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	Must have one	Class a part
86	your average Joe	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	Nice Phone	The iPhone 6 Plus is undoubtedly the best phone currently in the market. I switched from the iPhone 5 to the 6 Plus. The transition was seamless since I've been using the Iphones for the past several years now. I personally am a heavy internet user and use the phone to read a lot of stuff online. The iPhone 6 plus definitely fits the bill perfectly. For the first couple of days, you might naturally feel that buying such a large phone wasn't the smartest decision taken by you. But trust me, the phone simply grows on you and you easily adapt to the grip. Just make sure that you buy a silicon case before you start using the phone. The smooth finish of the phone can ironically result in a bad grip.   Snapdeal delivery was prompt and the packaging was excellent.   The ReGlobe exchange service however, is far from good. The website and follow up emails claimed that my old phone would be exchanged for cash on the spot during pick up. But a call centre lady later called on saying that they would just collect it and the cash would be transferred to my account at a later stage. I refused to agree to this and instead chose to sell it locally which fetched me a much better price.
87	Kannu	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	I believe in snapdeal	Nice as the lowest price i got on snapdeal
88	iamrajat01	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	And it's a mistake	The camera quality has let it down,I don't know if it has anything to do with purchasing online .But I think I made a mistake.

103	Prashanth	Jun 05, 2015	Yes	Go for it... its safe & secure	I am a regular e-buyer of gadgets & stuff. I ordered a Iphone 6 Plus on Snapdeal's Mobile day (25/05/15) at a very good offer price. The order was processed quickly & got the confirmation however the waiting period for delivery put me in frustration as seller had shipped the product within a day's time & it reached Bangalore on 26/05 but delivery agents took about 5-6 days to handover the product even after my regular follow ups with Snapdeal CC & GoJavas courier company.   My sincere request is to prioritize the delivery of high-value products to avoid dissatisfaction of any regular customer.

111	KhanAk	Jun 03, 2015	Yes	Class comes with a price	I have used iPhone in past but iPhone 6 plus is something else. Its far too perfect, be it in style, touch, quality.  Camera is just too perfect with HD++ quality. Clicking pictures is too easy and quick.  Battery backup is better than an android phone. I had charged it one morning, then did my usual stuff .. On second day half day passed, still I had 20% battery on it.  It might not suit everyone's pocket but for the ones who can, it surely is a treat.  Apple has delivered a bigger and better phone ever.
112	chd	Jun 03, 2015	Yes	100% orignal and genuine device...	100% original genuine device.... Thums up for SD+...

144	Alok	May 21, 2015	Yes	Awesome.. iPhone 6 plus	Great product, genuine with Apple warranty, must have for all who have a smarttphone in their shopping list. I personally opted for a bug screen phone since i owned a samsung Galaxy Note earlier. still 10 days with the beauty, but already giving me the return on my investment. Moreover got a good deal for a 128 gug version too. Battery backup is giving me early signs of weakness since i am a super heavy user of a smartphone for my business purposes. Well, lets wait and watch of whats more to unveil....

180	Deepak Bhakoo	May 08, 2015	Yes	Perfect Phone Indeed	This is how a phone is designed. Ok comes with a few flaws especially the top and bottom bar. Bottom is somewhat ok but top! Comeon. It looks awful.   iOS is amazing. Fast and fluid. Apps and games work absolutely wonderful. Yes the os is closed but still its a joy to operate every day.
181	Raees	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	awesome product	Perfect delivery from snapdeal and the product is awesome.

186	Guest	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Product is excellent, Delivery pathetic	Product: The product in itself is excellent, no complaints on that side.Using it for a week now...no bendgate type issue till now. Delivery: The seller used some xpressbees courier and it took  more than 7 days to deliver in lucknow from jaipur, which is slower than the indian post. Packaging: The packaging was good, the box was wrapped around with bubble sheet so no damages Would have given 5 star if the delivery time was less.
187	vels	Apr 28, 2015	No	advance working process inbuilt memory	more apps accept this mobile i like 8 mp camera
188	Sumeetg	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Perfect Buy	The performance of the phone is top notch. Screen is crisp, bright and displays true colours. Although the phone is 5.5 inches, it can be easily managed, I have small palms and despite that I can easily handle the phone. The weight is 172 gms but it doesn't feel bulky, or heavy. Comparing with the size you will experience it's light weight. I have used iPhone 6 also but i found the plus to be more appealing. Since the screen size is large and it's great to watch videos or browsing the web. Nowadays we don't watch videos more often but for web browsing purpose it is the best. The camera is one of the best, the optical image stabilisation works very well and the images come out clean and crisp. The battery is awesome, the battery lasts for 2 days after 2 hrs of voice calling, 4 hrs of web browsing and 1/2 hr camera usage, and 1 hr of music. The long lasting battery will probably draw large number of consumers to buy this mobile phone. Overall I am very delighted to own this beautiful piece of mobile phone.
189	Gopal	Apr 28, 2015	No	dam good..	bloody great for what it is and this is my 1st apple product i always had android before this and it is so much faster and the transitions are smoother had m8 which was a great phone but now have 6+ for 3 weeks a little different to android but i am working through it love it recommend it. Yes the battery life is awesome take it from a Android fan I love my iPhone 6 plusmy be thing is having to use a computer to put music on the phone I have an iPhone 6 Plus and it is the best! Best resolution and best battery life! buy it who can afford it! I have tried note2,note3,note4,htc,hawawi etc etc but iPhone 6 and plus has its own class superb screen resolution superb touch superb bouncing software and I would say no phone can come close to iPhone brothers and sisters please buy iPhone if you can afford. After having had the ip6+ I will say every feature advertised is near perfect. However it does take getting used to the physical size of the phone. This handling difference has been a real change in my handling habits. And I am 5'11. Of course there are a few bugs to be worked out in iOS 8 but that is to be expected. Battery life is excellent. But no better than my Droid Turbo that I have as well.  i like it very much.reason its brilliant quality and without hanging and lagging super sensitive touch and others its better than android any versions
190	Saurabh	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Excellent!	Got it delivered very fast and in excellent condition.
