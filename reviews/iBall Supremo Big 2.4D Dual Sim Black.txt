Here's my technical review  These are the items in the box :- Main Handset with 1800mAH battery 3.5mm Earphone Wall Charger of output 5v 500ma A back cover (very nice addition) Users manual & warranty card  Here's the actual specification of the mobile.

Very Good battery Life with dual sim support. Numberpad is good. 1year manufacturer warranty from iBall  Silicon backcover is supplied in the box.  Cons: No predictive dictionary available for faster typing. Switching from upper case to lower or numerical or vice versa is not so convenient. Memory is very low (like stored upto only 100sms)  So final conclusion If you need a budget secondary device alongside your smartphone for calling purpose or for your mom/dad with good battery life, just go for it. This will be the best choice at this price range. I'll rate this device 4.5 out of 5.0
