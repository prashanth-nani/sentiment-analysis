116	SUNIL	Jan 06, 2016	Yes	Pura Paisa Vasul....Excellent Infocus M680 Smartphone	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this.  Data cable to short. Front camera  selfie camera image not very good. Battery capacity is not more to increase upto 4000 mAH.

124	ri5hi	Jan 05, 2016	Yes	Avg phone! but with great built quality and design!	review after using for 4 days:- 1. the phone comes with a selfie stick worth 299-/ on snapdeal itself. 2. the accessories came : small cable size charger and cheap looking handsfree but good performance. 3. front camera takes decent pictures and back camera is avg. both camera is worst at low light performance.  4. phone gets slightly heated   pros: 1. best built quality and slim metallic design  2. decent 1080p display 3. octa core processor performs well 4. look wise it is classy phone   -->look wise it is recommended
125	Think_twice	Jan 05, 2016	Yes	An improved M535 and value for money, but sound lacks punch	Infocus seemed to have seriously pursued the Indian mobile market in 2015 with VFM handsets. Launch after launch they have tried to rectify the short comings and retain the selling USPs which has to be appreciated. In a buyersâ€™ market of Android VFM handsets, Infocus M680 is a sincere effort to provide an improved M535 with - better full HD display, added Airtel 4G band (only Reliance-Jio band was available in M535), better front camera (13MP vs 5 MP) for a selfie, and a free selfie-stick, all for just Rs. 1000 more. Thickness is perhaps slightly more compared to M535, but not easy to notice.  The design and style of the handset is a class apart from most other brand phones of matching hardware specs and price range. This is certainly a selling point. In general, a stylish phablet goes well with the womenfolk. The back surface of the handset has a kind of matte finish, enough to provide a non-slippery grip. But an additional back cover is strongly advised to avoid scratches to the back surface.  What is short of competition (known even before buying the handset, hence does not affect product rating)  â€¢ Lack of gorilla glass. â€¢ Inserting second SIM only possible if one doesnâ€™t need to use SD card to expand storage memory.  Short comings discovered after receiving the handset (I remove one star for these as these could be major deal breakers in my opinion):  â€¢ Speaker volume to for listening to music/video/games is inadequate. Disappointing indeed. Some customers/reviewers complained of distortions at higher volume. My handset does not attain such volumes at all! â€¢ The home keys are not backlit, hence takes time to get used to use in dark situations.  Both are perhaps not defects and the way they have been manufactured.  All  other normally-expected-things are good. Good touch screen, apps and videos run smoothly without jitters, common games play well. Heating, on par with handsets in this range. Android 5.1 is stable and smooth.  Camera is good enough. Excellent snaps especially in sunlight.   Battery life decent and lasts a full working day with normal usage with wifi.  Call quality is very good; network receptivity is also fine.  Availability of screen guards and cases is slowly growing. Spotted a couple of them on amazon and ebay.
126	sathya	Jan 05, 2016	Yes	good phone at this price	Hi.. this phone is good with overall performance. Both Camera quality is very good. Battery bakeup is good. It lasting for 14 hrs when high usage or 20 hrs when low usage eventhough the data connection or wifi is on and all day chatting with whatsapp and using fb. Sound quality is average for loud speakers. No heating issues. But data cable provided in the box is very small. i dont know why they provided small one Somewhat slow while playing high end 3d games.  If you are use to play games then consider lenova k3 note...
