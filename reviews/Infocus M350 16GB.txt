14	Vijakumar mali	Mar 29, 2016	Yes	In product containing with charging adoptor  have very short data cable	When purchasing product from snap deal  you should provide satisfaction to customor in all view . I purchase mobile in offer on price and save 500 but in product box containing very short data cable with adoptor , only one foot cable is provided , where I can put mobile when charging . This is not expected when I purchase product online . And also important that , the product bill is stick on box , when I needed invoice in service center then not keep the box for the period of warranty . I face to go computer and log in and then you send the invoice on email , I educated but some people not have laptop , computer , any more then he faces more difficulty to get invoice , I suggest than invoice should sent in box directly to keep for long time without any difficulty . Good beliveness of snapdeal . And connect more people in snapdeal and surely purchase without any trouble                   Thanks

59	Andy	Mar 16, 2016	Yes	A very good phone with great specifications	This is really a nice device. I am using for last 15 days.. The device has really nice specifications like 1.5 GHz 64 Bit Quad Core Processor, 4G Enabled,  2 GB RAM & 16 GB ROM, 12.7 cm (5) HD IPS Display, 8 MP Front & 8 MP Rear Camera and relatively  low price. Because if you want a device with same specifications of brand like samsung or sony or motorola,  it would price more than Rs. 12,000.  So, according to me this phone  is really very nice on the basis of its memory  and price...It is very  good phone for a person who wants a  budget friendly phone.

74	Dev	Mar 11, 2016	Yes	Good Product ,with a slight hardware/ software issue	I  purchased this phone from Snap Deal.. Happy to use it.. RAM -2GB is good enough to load huge apps in the phone. Handset doesn't get slow by loading the apps. Camera : 8MP front and Back - satisfactory. Low light photos are good , but they get a hazzy outline on zooming.Voice quality is really good and lively..   I found these issues in the Handset:  (1) Internet connectivity (3G) does not get connected on one go..I had to reboot the hardware and it connects successfully..  (2) Alarm - when i set the alarm , it missed some events..didn't give alarm.. (3) UI is not very interactive , although looks same as any phone.. but doesn't have default apps for photo and sound .. like in Asus Zenfone.

92	TD	Mar 07, 2016	Yes	expected better	this is my first android mobile, charger cable is very short, 1.5feet only, phone is quite oversize than other 5 inch mobiles. Expected better battery backup , not like 2500mah battery. My friends told battery is providing average backup. Snapdeal saying that M350 is using Dragon Glass as screen protection, but no info on Dragon glass is available on InFocus website.
93	arifulrehman	Mar 07, 2016	Yes	Perfect device under 7k	Using this phone from more than 2 weeks It has nice battery backup, rear camera is Good, front is awesome both 8mp, display is the best 720p resolution you can get under this price point, speakers is nice,Games play very well just only one little issue sometimes sim one net doesn't work but I found the solution just activate & then deactivate the airplane mode which refreshes the network, But that's just a minor thing. So I would definitely Recommend this to my friends.

178	Guest	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	awesome deal	It's really worth it for that price
179	Suresh AJ	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Beast at this price…Worthy to buy…	I am normally power user. I search many mobiles in recent years from low budget to high budget and plan to buy IPhone but in future. So I choose the low budget for about my uses so I choose this one after reading and watching many reviews about this mobile for this price.   Here i going to share some pros and cons in my experience.  I used this mobile for past one month and there are no issues. Snapdeal reaches in two days from my order request. Packaging is average but still this is enough I think.   Pros:   Slim and curved back so handling in one hand is easy   2GB Ram with 1.5Ghz processor so the speed is good and no lags. Now a days some device comes with 3gb ram but processor speed is less this is not gives best supports to ram speed. So here we need ram and processor speed in even also we need to look gpu speed for better gaming performance. And this one is also gives the good performance for heavy gamings.   And default launcher and file manager is good so nice to handle.   You can use the internet in any network coverage 2g/3g/4g in both sim slots based on your net pack. Both sim slots supports 2g/3g/4g you can choose this manually in settings under cellular networks and sim card>cellular data settings but 3g/4g coverage supports only one sim slot at one time i.e same time.   OS come with lollipop 5.1 update so for the first boot you need to wait some time then it update apps in first boot. If not boot correctly then you need to hold the power key to shut off then power on manually again.   Given sensor is good with this price but still expect some more sensor like ambient sensor so double tap wake up screen is not possible with this device but you can use the proximity and shake.   Navigation keys are inside on the screen. And you align the navigation keys in your own choice.   Display clarity is good they made with extra sharpness but its not good for camera shoots and view. And all viewing angle is good so you can see the videos and pictures in any angle. Color clarity is good and colors are never changed in all the sides of viewing angles. May be it make some changes in next update to the sharpness level.   Mobile assistant and Device finder some default apps gives good assist for manual service. So you don’t need some extra app for make phone speed and better battery performance. Like 360app. But still I use that for malware detection.   There is no gorilla glass but still dragontrail glass is available so you don’t feel about display protection. In market gorilla glass got the top position whether dragontail is next.     Cons:   Camera gives some noises in low light and distant captures but this is happen normally in other devices too but with this price range this is good. But shooting cam pics are good viewing in other devices is good/bad one. Still daylight capture is awesome.   Battery drains completely after moderate usage within 9hrs but still power saver is the good option to save battery life. And maintaining good battery backup is in your hand based on your usage and maintenance. Below 15% battery drains immediately so you need to charge from 20%. I charge once in a day.   After watching so many videos, playing games the device heat up quickly but not too heating also internet usage. But compare with some device this is better.   Touch is average so you need a original screen guard i.e rich price screed guard to get more smooth touchiness.   Very chip headset so you need to buy a good one in a local shop.   Charger adapter is need improvement its taking 2.45hrs time to charge from 5% to 95%.   Note:  In this price range I surely recommend this product you believe to buy this one. Now this price range coolpad note 3 lite available so I recommend that too. So you can buy any of this both surely in this price.

205	Deva33	Feb 12, 2016	Yes	The Economic Beast Phone from Infocus!!	I am very much happy with this product after 4 months of usage.  Tested each and every aspect of phone and its awesome.  The best thing in the phone is the sound output which is loud and clear ( Best). HD screen is superb and both the camera's produce nice images.  The only drawback i see is the battery usage. We need to use the powersave mode in order to extend the battery life. Infocus M350 should have a higher mah battery considering the screen factor. Other than this the phone is recommendable to everyone.  Thanks!

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

475	M.Kannan	Nov 27, 2015	Yes	Best phone at this price range.	Considering the price point of view it is a nice phone.  5 inch IPS display {294 ppi} is very good  which one can't expect at this price range. Call quality is very nice.  2GB/16GB Ram/ROM is an added advantage. Camera quality is fine. Call Record option is provided by default. safebox app is provided to lock apps like whatsapp etc which is working perfectly. On the flip side UI is clumsy which can be modified by other Launcher or OS to be upgraded. Sound quality of external speaker is not so good. Feeling light heat [tolerable] when playing games.   Finally no phone can be compared with this phone at this price point. A very good phone.

580	ram	Nov 09, 2015	Yes	its fine but...	manufacturer has work on display screen, if INFOCUS really want to compete with 5.5 display screen models work on it but don't spoil the model with stupid extra edges at top and bottom of the phone we don't find any use of those edges in the phone after 5.0 Inch display..  You have wasted 1 inch space just to display your INFOCUS company name.. its really hard for us to use this phone...

Thanks to Snapdeal for matching me with a such real buddy.
590	Vanaj	Nov 06, 2015	Yes	Xcellent phone, but 4 stars for accessories	This phone is too good for its price. 3G speed is very good. Back camera is not great but does decent job, but front camera is awesome. I have faced no lags at all and am fully satisfied. The only problem is, that the phone and the charger heat a bit. As for accessories, the earphone is not upto the mark, with no rubber fitted. Its the old traditional kind of earphone, and not comfortable. I am hence using my old micromax earphone for this. Also, the data cable provvided is very short, like a cheap Chinese one.  Otherwise, I would suggest you, just go for it without thinking twice. The looks are better than what they seem in the picture(I am saying for the black one), the phone is too good. InLife UI is best anroid UI I have ever seen. I didn't expect this much from a newcomer American company. I blindly recommend this phone. All my firends want to  have this mobile in their hand. My firend has even decided to order it. Its sleed and attarctive. The led light is not flashy. I am just so happy I bought infocus. Lollipop upgrade is available, but I have decided not to upgrade it, as some have said that the speaker didn't function well after the update and other such things. Otherwise, its good.

Guys initially who made fun about my phone also started to love it now after they checked the screen quality and camera. It has its own flaws but cant demand much for this price.

625	chandu	Nov 01, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

At this cost having 2ddr3 ram and 16gb inbuilt memory, and the lightening speed of the this product can beat a iPhone speed, when I checked with my iPhone 6plus the result scores for infocous when I had provided both the 4g SIM in it for 5min Hd plus song at a time with both, but the result is my iPhone 6plus took 1.30 min and the infocous M350 took only 35second, I was shocked and also awesome beeter  than the best comparison with any other 4g mobiles. Simply I took iPhone 6plus for such a huge amount and no battery life compare to infocous M350 having such a long lasting battery life performance.  Once again thank you snapdeal.  Regards FAROOQ ALI

753	Samrat	Oct 18, 2015	Yes	Infocus	Good  mobile and the snap deal order too fast and to good
754	Ol'rawnder Saini	Oct 18, 2015	Yes	Absolute ripper at the cost!!	it has a rich look, with steel edges around the body making it look classy ;) i am a hardcore gamer and this phone HEATS UP a lil only when you play it on full graphics with brightness set up more than 50%. else there arent quite heating issues for my device. the camera quality is more way too good. 8MP cam front and back shoot up images quite rich. the only con I personally felt is that all apps are kind of stored automatically in the internal storage despite moving them to the sd card.... or some sh***t like that... the design and looks are beautiful...   ONE NOTE FOR EVERYONE                       ( 17/10/15 ) plz plz plz plz dont upgrade to android 5.1 from your stock ROM.... your phone's gonna slow down a bit..... it aint that stable. dont dont dont dont dont upgrade.... even if you do, downgrade back to the stock rom if you can.... it occupies a lot of internal memory and the notification pane is absurd! it really really sucks! when you rotate your phone you cant view your notifications as they're all stacked up one on another, making it impossible to view your notifications..... i dont write reviews but the only reason I'm writing this one is because i really loved this product, which has satisfied me completely, and wanted to create awareness amongst the other people for not upgrading to the lollipop version.....   I too had the same problem of recieving too many cell broadcasts at one point and not being able to disable that annoying that thing... well just install the upgrade from the upgrades menu and that should solve that permanently....   I've suggested this product to some 4 friends already and they're completely into this product.... If you're a gamer and into graphics, trust me this is the ultimate economical cellphone for you.  Ol'rawnder Saini is my gaming profile name on  shadwogun, dead trigger( 1 & 2 ), real racing 3, bomb squad, 8 ball pool, and many other multiplayer android games ;)

810	Raam	Oct 14, 2015	Yes	Ok mobile for the investment.	2 GM Ram, 16 GB internal memory, 8 Mp Fr & Rr Camera, Battery ok  Though screen size is 5 inches, display is 4.5 inches only. Bottom of the mobile is printed with "INFOCUS" name which consumes more than 1 cm, soft keys are not placed in bottom of the phone but placed inside the display screen which reduced the display size. Typing in message is not user friendly. Vibration is activated by default by typing in message. 2nd Sim is not 3g/4g compatible.  Task Manager is waste on the desk top. It is not able to get hidden by any means. Screen is not getting locked during attending calls, hence it starts activating other buttons while touching in ears.

816	Rohit Nani	Oct 14, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	Absolutely Awesome phone (Fully Satisfied) I am writing this review after 18 days of use. In holidays after whole 1 month search I chose this phone which has really great performance, battery backup and looks. 1. Phone has great performance due to its 2GB ram and Quad core processor. No lags while playing games like Subway, FL Commando, GTA and many more. 2. Call Quality is really good. 3. Key factor about phone is that Battery backup is awesome  nearly 20 hrs on heavy usage. 4. Phone is slim and the design made by Infocus engineers allow the phone to be fitted perfectly in your hands. 5. SAR value of the phone is less 0.53 which made me to reject Lenovo K3 note which has SAR value 1.59 which is really dangerous for health of people. 6. Rear Camera is good and Front Camera is more better. 7.good display and smooth touch. 8.metal frame is strong and looks rich. people comes to look the mobile. 9.good sound quality and call quality. 10.no heating problem on 3G as well as call unlike yuphoria and yureka. 11. good service center backup. service through accel service- one of best warranty management firm.

823	Surinder	Oct 13, 2015	Yes	Very good phone & fast delivery	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands

968	Nags	Oct 10, 2015	Yes	Worth every penny	I want to summarize my experience with Infocus M350 in two catergories:  PROS:  - Looks wise, its very nice for me and it depends on person to person.  - The HD display is real treat to watch, we don't find any pixels on the screen  and the screen feel very smooth to use, the finger just glides over it.  - Coming to the speed, its performs as per the specifications.  The response is smooth and we don't need to wait for opening or closing any applications.  - I like the Camera.  It produces very good pictures and many of my friends are just wondering with the quality of the results.  There is not much noise and the color reproduction is very accurate and we can get very good amount of details and the depth of the pictures also impressive, overall a very good camera.  - Music of the phone is very pleasing, the like the Bass in the sound more then tremble.  - There is nothing to complain about call quality, the sound is very clear and we don't find any problem with that.   Cons: - Looks bit long. - Battery back up doesn't break any records.  One day for sure with moderate usage.  I will surely recommend this product for those who want Speed and who want very good quality photos in Camera.  Thanks, Nagaraj.K HYD

1059	srinivas	Oct 07, 2015	Yes	Review on Infocus M350	Nice mobile with great features under low range budget mobiles. Excellent touch sensitivity and camera quality. Designing is very good to hold the mobile while playing the games.The best thing about the InFocus M350 is its front camera. An 8 megapixel front camera and that too with auto focus ability speaks volume for itself.Connectivity wise too it is like most of its competitors. It offers dual SIM with 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS.
1060	Manish	Oct 07, 2015	Yes	Awesome product for the price	This is a superb phone .. great display.. snappy... great camera and battery life... and now with Android Lollipop Upgrade it is more than value for money.. go for it
1061	Johnny	Oct 07, 2015	Yes	Infocus M350 16GB	I bought this phone for my wife. The specs, which are on the website, bring out that this phone has all the required bells & whistles. It is a dual sim with both sims supporting 4g (only one 4g can be used at one time). The display is very good. After i received it, there was an OTA update available, and I carried it out to update the OS version. After that I set up the phone . It was then I realised that the camera was not working. So I finally had to do a factory reset, after which the camera started working. So, if you do the OTA update check the functioning of all sensors before setting up the phone. The camera problem seems to have been a one off affair. Otherwise, the camera is very good. The battery backup is also very good - goes for 24 hrs with 3g on all through. On the whole, an excellent phone.
1062	santhosh	Oct 07, 2015	Yes	santhosh akula	nice phone....i love it ....but i feel bad with snapdeal  for extra shipping charges, the other sites are providing free delivery, and more over even some times they are giving direct cash back or discount but i never seen in last three months..such dicsounts.

Good responsive phone, the touch is good and she has been able to do her regular work on it. The camera is good when there is sufficient sunlight. Lowlight performance is not bad, but not great.

1169	Aman Rajpoot	Oct 02, 2015	Yes	Don't think just buy it.	It might seems to be a budget phone but it's a beast for the amount you paying. Best 5 inch HD screen in it's price segment (under 10 thousand rupees), dragon trail screen protection which is similar to gorilla glass 2 and much more.  MT6732 1.5GHz 64bit quad core processor with Mali T760 GPU combined with 2gb of ram gives similar performance to Snapdragon 615 octa core processor which is insane. Just got the Lollipop 5.1 update and antutu benchmark score reaches 32000+.  Best front facing camera in it's price segment and the back camera is also much better than the phones available in it's price segment (under 10 thousand rupees).  All HD games run at highest setting without any lag and there's no heating issues like other Indian or Chinese brands.  And the best part, battery easily last the whole day and for casual users it might last even 1.5 days.  Best phone ever for 5 inch screen lovers or for those  who want phone under 9 thousands.  Just go for it...

1193	Ravi	Oct 01, 2015	Yes	Great Specs at Average Appearance!	Yes, It has great specs at this price range. But hands on experience slightly different.  1) Actual Screen size is small when compared to other brands phones with same size. In that home screen buttons eaten quite good space of screen thus making further smaller.  2)Colour saturation of images taken from rear camera is not good and Images looks some what different.

1196	Anish	Oct 01, 2015	Yes	Infocus M350 16GB	Very nice mobile. . Space of 16gb and speed is awesome
1197	trusisodia	Oct 01, 2015	Yes	Really good product and worth of every single penny spent. But.....	Hello friends, I'm writing this review after 16 days of usage in order to provide full details. So I'll try out to touch every expect of this phone honestly. It might become a lengthy one, but I promise that it'll help you definitely while making final decision for Infocus m350.  Camera: Definitely it's more than average in this price range. Front camera is quite good for selfies. Back camera is ok-ok without zoom in daylight. Flash is quite handy and I really liked it in the night shoot. Well details are not good when you zoom before taking picture, all becomes blurred like. Hence 8/10.  Design: Design is what I didn't like much except back finish. The reason is quite simple. It has too much plastic below and above the screen and you might find yourself puzzled while handling the phone in one hand. Though I have long fingers still I found it tedious to touch farthest corner of the phone. I can imagine the problem those guy will face who have small fingers. Power and volume buttons are on the different sides, and hence you end up clicking the other side button without any intention too.  Though it looks premium from the back side and people come to you to see and use it.  At last I would like to advice people having small hands (fingers/palm) that you should be aware of this fact before purchasing any phone otherwise you'll end up using both of your hands while using phone. So  4/10  Display(Touch, Screen & Brightness): Touch is what I liked really much. It's really butter smooth and brightness is quite good. Content on phone is easily legible under direct sunlight. Hence you won't have to run for the shade to see an important message on the phone. And not to forget that screen looks sturdy too. It's 5 Inch with IPS LCD, 1280 x 720 Pixel Resolution You can't expect beyond this in price range. Therefore 10/10  Hardware & Software: 2GB DDR3 RAM is really fast and processing is quite fast with 1.5GHZ quad core Mediatek processor with Mali-T760 GPU. Multitasking is superb. Actually once I had around 20 apps open in the background and still the process was smooth. But still one thing is worth to be mentioned.  When I was playing Sniper 3d Assault, I faced the problem of sudden "stopped working". And sudden crashing of Google Maps though I had updated it too. But still no success. Firmware is Android Kitkat which is quite outdated now when you see that there are some more updates in Lollipop too. And I'm suspicious about its future Lollipop update too. And you won't find too many bloatwares like any similar price range phone. OTG support is quite handy for me as I can easily watch loads of movies directly by attaching the pen drive with it.  9/10  Battery and Storage: Internal Storage is 16GB with expansion slot upto 32GB Battery is  a really positive side of this though it's not removable and it took around 2hours to be charged from 0 to 100. I'm hopeful that it will take less time with 2.0Amp charging head.. And I had been playing for more than 3 hrs and still battery was well above 50% from full recharge with data on. One thing should also be mentioned that it heats up a little bit more than charging while you play heavy games but it's still well under the control and you won't have to run to put your phone in the fridge. Just kidding. :).  9.5/10  Accessories: Charger could have been better. Headphone quality is below average though sound is really loud and clear while using FM, but headphone doesn't fit easily in the ears. Hence I'll recommend Sony or any other good branded headset to buy and listen your favorite songs. Hence 7/10  Miscellaneous: just standard things which are identical now-a-days like 4G, Dual Sim, aGPS, BLUETOOTH, 3.5mm jack,  WIFI a/b/g/n(not ac), some more things. But don't be puzzled there isn't any such thing which will make you really worried later on.   Final Verdict: You must go for it unless you have shorter hands than average. This is the best phone in the price range of 5000-9000 right now.  Thanks for reading, trusisodia

Very minute  heating while playing games.  Cons: 1. Extended mobile size because of brand name written at the bottom. Seems like 5.5Inch phone. 2. No double tap to unlock phone.

1210	Vaseem khan	Sep 30, 2015	Yes	Yes , I would surely recommend this mobile to everyone , who wanna buy a decent and amazing phone a.	I extremely delighted to share my thoughts and experience about infocus m350 . Yes it's really a cool mobile to be bought at such a decent price. The phones design is quite ergonomic , it has large bezel that is very helpful when you watch videos . Phone display is extremely ssharp and clear. watching videos on this display is  delightful experience. On-cell technology makes the display on eyes. Playing games on the infocus m350 is a real bliss , as it has good sound quality and high graphics. Audio quality in the headphones and on ringer a very impressive . The battery gives much better back up. The most important and special thing about the infocus m350 is the sim-switch functionality . you can use 3g and 4g network on sim1 or sim2. This phone is a great gadget . 7 star phone at 4digit price. Thanks
1211	sahil	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Super Phone	It is the most amazing phone,which I m using trustuted american brand and a genuine product from snapdeal. Its camera,performance,stylish look just superb.thanks snapdeal for this awesome phone.
1212	Prabhakar	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Awsome product	before this i bought m2 Overall my rating is 10 outoff 9 in all segments. this brand definitely shakes the market.
1213	mini patakha	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Superb Android mobile	I m very much happy wid this product.nice touch screen,glassy look,fast like any thing. Working smoothly,nicely.
1214	Nick	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Value of maney	This shet Osama picture quality . And good luck
1215	chauhan	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Amazing mobile	Good 4 d cost  Nice overall experience  Recommended
1216	Sreesh	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Good	I booked the phone on launch day & thanks SD for next day delivery & making available this excellent product. Now regarding phone it is light wt. with attractive looks & performance wise excellent. Till today havn't faced any problem,no hang or no lag issue. Battery back up is approx 11-12 hrs.with continous net on & 2-3 hrs of phn calls & 1-2hrs of surfing & downloading. Don't know about gaming performance as i am not interested in playing the games. Touch is butter smooth & display is excellent.No complaints about call quality.Picture quality of front & back cameras is also very nice. Only one problem faced was,i was getting continuous cell broadcast messages & there was no option to stop/disable them. But today i received software update & after update i haven't received any message since last 2hrs. Thanks Infocus team. One main disadvantage is removal of back cover is little difficult & not user friendly. Another disadvantage may be there is no gorila glass but it can be resoved by applying screen protector.  Now if your budget is under 10k,don't even give a second thought ,just buy this phone.
1217	Kaushal	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Value for money	I searched for a long time for similar device and finally zeroed on to this one. And what a lucky choice it has been! Perfect for this price range.   Pros Large screen Superb finish with thin edges (smart designing) Ample free memory space Good battery life  Cons Heats up at times when out in sunlight (maybe due to quad core and my back cover)  Overall - Would recommend it!

Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices.

1240	chintu.chakraborty2	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Great handset	Good handset but missing something.  Pros-   1) First one battery.

Cons-  1) missing lollipop.  2) 64 bit processor but runs on 32 bit os( Kitkat)  After all its a good phone within budget. If you want performance then its a good phone fits your pocket (My opinion).

1496	Jyoti Sharma	Sep 19, 2015	Yes	Too good for it's price tag	I have spent so much over phones, and this was something I never craved for, it just happened. I broke my old 800 USD phone screen, and the repair charges were high, so I opted for the new ones.  Infocus is into high end projectors, but they have done a sweet job by getting into phone making. This has a Q core MTK processor unlike the big league Qualcomm, but it packs enough punch.  The phone has two sides 8 Mp camera, which isn't bad too.   I hope we have a quick upgrade to Lollipop, but even without that it still is a power product. I saw reviews calling it extra tall phone, with a lot of space to the ends, but over a period of usage I found that it is pretty eye-catching.  I laid it on the table to strangers and asked the price they mostly guessed it to around 15k.  I draw the lines here:  Great: Screen resolution, looks, touch sensitivity Happy: Swapping between apps, 16Gb space, Sound, 4G Okay: Battery, sunlight viewing, voice call quality
1497	Nagendiran	Sep 19, 2015	Yes	Not up to that expected level....but not a waste one	Good one...but can be much better. Having broad screen...could have added more features.

1533	visha	Sep 15, 2015	Yes	Size is too over because of the extra portion	The phone should be manufactured newly by reducing its large portion of unneedy area , so that it will be simple to handle n also make it little more weightless. And the other factor I feel difficulty is the overheating. If u overcome this then I promise u can rule the market of android phones
1534	Chandu	Sep 15, 2015	Yes	Awesome phon	I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

1772	Jazz	Sep 06, 2015	Yes	Surprisingly Great!!	This is an unbiased review of this phone which I bought almost a week from this date and I must say this is a wonderful phone.   After having used Moto G 1st Gen 16 GB, Lenovo A7000, Lenovo A536, Samsung Galaxy phones - Infocus has definitely worked on this phone to ensure it is top notch and not a half baked one like Micromax and Lava. One thing I always considered before buying any phone is its battery back up. To amazement, M350 has an excellent battery backup. I am usually always on the internet with dual SIMs, continuous email syncing, FB and Whatsapp, this phone has never ever run out of juice. If it is fully charged at 8AM in the morning, by the time it is 8PM, the charge leftover has never gone down below 40% (without any intermediate charging).   Though it runs on Kitkat 4.4.4, the UI has been customized to make it snappy and has a lot of tweaks to my liking.   Another best thing - Infocus has followed the approach of iPhone 5 wherein to accommodate a 5-inch screen, they have made the phone longer but not wider. This is perfect for my hands since I can use my left hand to type without shuffling the phone around on my palm. The size is absolutely perfect. In addition, with 294ppi density, the screen is astonishingly sharp with perfect colour reproduction.   All in all - this is an excellently balanced phone in all areas and definitely a recommended buy. Hopefully, they will come up with Lollipop soon, if at all they will.

Third class quality of EARPHONE. You will find such earphone in less than 50bucks on Mumbai street. 2. The box doesn't contain a SCREEN GUARD. You won't find the screenguard in any local store. I was not able to find it in Mumbai and later ended up buying screen guard online paying extra than usual. 3. Don't expect a USER MANUAL.            IN THE END I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

1869	NITU	Sep 03, 2015	Yes	In focus performance	in today"s life when internet remains ON all the time and  uses are more then battery power is to be enhanced because it is a two SIM phone. Camera is good. it does not get heated up if use for a long time.    Opening the back cover is a little bit difficult. if you don't have nails you can't open it . So if you planning to buy this phone start raising your nails too because both the SIMs and memory card are under back cover

1878	Pradip	Sep 03, 2015	Yes	Should be value for money	I am not able to review this product as this is my first purchase for a smart phone. and it is freaking me out for UI.  And I am not able to connect to the Internet for email/browsing or for APPS. My main objective was to use it for Bank etc.  I use Tatadocomo. It shows 3G. Tatadocomo service people could not able to help me. the user manual is very short and does not deal with it. UI (for me) is not intuitive and it does not have a MAIN MENU - that is frustrating me. 2nd - UI keep changing as a slight touch will make it happen and I am not able to stop it or get it back. So frustrating for me now. But that would have been my experience for any other brand of smart phone. So far on technical and theoratical comparison - it looked like a VALUE for Money. And that is why I bought it and not SAMSUNG - which is my favourite brand.

2007	Arvind	Aug 30, 2015	Yes	awesome product for value of my money	I am writing this review after 5 days of recieving this product, Very first look of the phone was thin and stunning, I continously tested this phone by activating 3g on my mobile and parallely playing high end games, but did not noticed any overheating on this phone and the battery backup was very gud , it long lasted full day while playing the game with full brightness.  coming to the camera quality the pictures are more bright and colorfull , even after zooming the pics the quality was good enough  for both front and rare camera which is 8 megapixel.  Since Indian phones are majorly dominated by the chineese mobiles, Infocus landed here with   providing high quality mobile for the low price and I am highly satisfied with this mobile and recommend others to go for it.

Infocus looks just so elegant in her hand. wont go with the detailed specs review as m no expert. the curvy shape and the touch screen is just awesum. the sound clarity for calls is great. the speakers are too good n hear even in full volume which is quite loud. and other few software features/ gestures makes it a complete package. i would certainly recommend it to any1. even if u hv a 10-15 budget go for this fone n save ur money for sumthing else. DONT HESITATE even for a second . But i dont understand why therez no proper accessories. headfone is cheap n nothing else excpt charger. Atleast original flipcovers, tempered glass should be available in market. plz make a way so that customers cud get the original accessories at the EARLIEST in ur site.  Snapdeal ..i really appreciate the way u hav handled this order. it has reached to my local courier within notime. but very much disappointed with the local courier office of GoJavas. they r just so lethargic to deliver goods in time. we hav 2 wait for their proper time and place. in my case it took 7 days from their office to my place. plz Snapdeal kindly DEAL wid this if possible. And also the Packaging quality of the fone was 2 star. even the fone sealed box was tampered due to improper handling may b while shipping or by the local courier. Kindly try to use good packing materials atleast bubble papers.  Infocus M350- 5 stars out of 5 Accessories-    3 stars  Packaging and Handling- 2 stars GoJavas local courier (darjeeling)- Nil

Scores around 32000 on AnTUTU Rear 8 mp camera is good but front is better than back camera. both captures clear images. Battery backup is quite good but not as expected. Not heats up like others while gaming. Brighter display with bluelight filter and adjustable color temperature. Runs almost all graphic intensive games like asphalt 8 airborne etc.   Cons:  Consumes much time for full charge. Thats all.

For those who're complaining about camera,try to click on HDR mode it'll take fews extra seconds but the noise would be cleared alot.

2088	sunil	Aug 26, 2015	Yes	Good phone for me	oßod job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very        nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
2089	Mani	Aug 26, 2015	Yes	HighSpec phone at worthy price	Phone is really nice, very slim with good battery backup and nearly high end specs at very aggressive price. Even SAR also very much within the limit of standards - 0.537 W/kg & 0.677 W/kg at head and body respectively.  Surprisingly, on first charge battery lasted for nearly 2 days which is unbelievable, hope good run continues. Only con is on screen to body ratio is poor.

We can get through more than 48 hours of average usage. Supports OTG. :-) It has many sensors. (9 sensors)  CONS -  The phone is a bit long. The provided accessories are a bit cheap.

2141	Rajkumar	Aug 18, 2015	Yes	great but not best	i used this mobile for one whole day . now my experience with this device is . 1)camara is good . front camara is capturing must good photos .(4 out of 5) 2)with 2 GB RAM ,you will never feel to use a RAM cleaner app. (5 out of 5) 3)the android version in this device is looks like a jellibean. i did not like the UI . it feels very bore to use the device . the android version UI is bad but is support many features like :you can connect joystick or mouse or USB storage . it support "wifi display and gives some what stock android experience. (3 out of 5) 4)the processor is a 1.5 ghz quad core(64bit) CPU. this makes me very happy with device . this is a low cost mediatek processor chipset but its performance is too good . the device runs at a jet speed.(5 out of 5) 5)before i rooted my device "its not at all give me 1 full day backup ".so i rooted my device and  decrease the CPU speed to 1.2 ghz . now my device not at all heating or draining battery very fast now. now i am getting  1 day backup easily . can you expect 8 hours countinuos gaming with 1 full charge . this device made it .battery life is awesome (only if your device is ROOTED and decrease the CPU speed to optimum usage.(4 out of 5 ) 6)since it is a mediatek chipset based mobile ,so there is no guaranty that your device will get update to lallipop or other version . but android  kitkat is very stable and RAM efficient . (4 out of 5)

Cons: - Slight heating when using internet. - There is no option to select 2G network..When no 3g network,it will automatically catch 2G signal.Thanks to operators who give internet access to 3G data for 2G packs. - The back cover is very thin  and can be broken with a little misuse. -Android kitkat..its not a con actually.. - No idea about Gorilla glass. - No upgrade to lollipop is announced.   Its a very good phone under 7k.. Complete value for money..

2193	Prakash	Aug 11, 2015	Yes	Absolutely Awesome phone (Fully Satisfied)	I am writing this review after 18 days of use. In holidays after whole 1 month search I chose this phone which has really great performance, battery backup and looks. 1. Phone has great performance due to its 2GB ram and Quad core processor. No lags while playing games like Subway, FL Commando, GTA and many more. 2. Call Quality is really good. 3. Key factor about phone is that Battery backup is awesome  nearly 20 hrs on heavy usage. 4. Phone is slim and the design made by Infocus engineers allow the phone to be fitted perfectly in your hands. 5. SAR value of the phone is less 0.53 which made me to reject Lenovo K3 note which has SAR value 1.59 which is really dangerous for health of people. 6. Rear Camera is OK and Front Camera is more better.  Only the Screen guard and back cover is not provided and the head phones are of low quality but at this price you should go for this phone. Snapdeal delivery was also fast just within 2 days I got my product.

2228	Nasir	Aug 06, 2015	Yes	Good phone	Specifications are good. Battery back up is good for average user. Battery even after 48 hours, that include 6 hours of wifi, shows 36% remaining (didn't check gaming). NO heating issue with my phone but charger provided with my phone heats up while charging. back panel is slippery so you need to be cautious otherwise it will slip from your hand easily. It is also bit lengthy it took me time to adjust my grip on the phone but now its little bit OK. Quality of both the camera is very good. wrinkle reducing and beautification feature is there on the front camera. Sound is decent (not too loud), loud in ear phone.  Display is good and sharp. Touch is sensitive. Safebox is there in which you can keep the document that you want to keep safe (open only through password). Gesture feature are there such as flip to end call and lift to silent, direct call etc. I didn't find inverse trigonometric function in calculator but you can download calculator from play store. Castscreen feature is there but it need other device have NFC, wireless screen sharing is there (this sort of feature is not that used in daily life). User interface is very customizable . All the features are working fine. BUT this phone may sometimes require to use your both hand to operate it and this problem is there with most of 5 inch or higher smartphone. therefore if you want to buy a smartphone that you can work with very comfortably by one hand then go for the 4.2 inch screen size.as on the large screen the number of icon per screen will increase that is of no use for me. it is difficult to reach to the power button with the thumb if your thumb is on option button or menu icon, without changing your palm position. Metallic rim looks good. Charging time is ok. Latest specification with 4g (though 4g service is not in my state but the phone is future ready). 16 gb memory, more than sufficient for me for now, expandable option is there if you need more. 2 gb ram good for heavy use (nonetheless 1gb ram is more than sufficient for mobile if you are not a very heavy user). Overall a good phone. if you really need a five inch screen size phone and a 4inch (or so) is not at all you can work with then you can go for this phone otherwise go for 4inch(or so) screen size phone that will offer you comfort in handling and working.
2229	Thiru	Aug 06, 2015	Yes	Thiru	1. Both cameras are very clear and focus is good 2. Good memory with 16 GB 3. INternet speed is good 4. Voice clarity is perfect. 5. Worth to buy with this price
2230	Ram	Aug 06, 2015	Yes	Great mobile at awesome mobile	You will love this mobile about it's specification and working well. It's some features in default. RAM clearing,power saving,app blocking. Front facing camera is better even in low light. Not to mention Back camera is awesome. This mobile fulfill the things required. Wonderfull camera, 2GB RAM, Processor, Display and finally price is so great. Go for it blindly.
2231	SAGAR	Aug 05, 2015	Yes	one of the best at its range	After much consideration i was stuck between lenovo k3 note, infocus m350 and yureka plus and all other mobiles in this range.But finally bought infocus.  pros: -best selfie cam -can play very high end games like asphalt 8,real racing 3,without a glitch and also we can multitask at the same time because of 2gb ram.some of the games couldn't be plays in k3 note with such graphics and absolutely no lag. -very good color reproduction in back cam.The flash produces perfect color. -no/less heating problem which is common due to heavy games perfect looks and awesome build quality.the gold color looks good above all(in my opinion) -good viewing angles   cons: -still running on kitkat and no promises for updates. -gorilla or dragon glass should have been provided.  finally go for it blindly if u are not a rough user.or have a flip cover and tempered glass for it.
2232	Sarit	Aug 05, 2015	Yes	Great phone at a great price !!	Very good battery life , good call hearing volume, very nice camera. Cool display, at a very attractive price.
2233	uppi	Aug 05, 2015	Yes	best mobile with best features	i purchased infocus M350 recently and i am extermely happy with the features coming to the pros and cons.  pros: camera clarity is very good both front and rear battery stand for 2 days for me (i dont use the mobile for playing games) outer curved design of the mobile give very good look 16 gb in built blue light filter option work very nice 4G/3G/2G  cons: mobile length is 15.1 cm, it looks a little bit lenghthy than other mobiles like redmi 4, 2 Unable to find a suitable flip covers as it is a new mobile entered into the market Except this i love the entire features and performance of the mobile.

2242	Shabarish	Aug 03, 2015	Yes	Amazing phone with awesome performance	This is my first owned android device,I have been used this device for past 4 days and I really amazed by the performance by the sturdy INFOCUS m350 .  Pros, ~Battery backup is awesome , it easily comes for a whole day use with surfing internet for 3-4 hours, playing games for 4 hours and normal usage of chatting and phone calls. after that also It got 20% of battery remaining. ~During these hours of gaming and surfing I didn't experience much heating issues as compared to the mobiles my frnds are having. ~Sound quality is good, ~Camera is impressive for taking pics but not for video recording,  ~Regarding front camera, it does a great job. selfies are came in a very impressive way. ~LED notification is awsm, touch responsive s quick enough, Downloading speed is superb.. ~Ergonomic design for better holding grip, can be operate with one hand easily.  Now coming to cons, ~though it s easy to operate with one hand as it is less in breadth it having the big bezels at the bottom which gives the look of too tall to this phone as compared to other 5 inch phones (this phone is having the height of 5.5 inch mobiles that almost equal to INFOCUS m530 and ASUS zenfone 2 which my frnds r having)  ~ Second thing Though the Camera performance for taking pics is awesome I am quite disappointed while video recording , its horrible :( By default it little bit zoom and the nearby objects looking clear but the objects which is just 5 steps far looks glumpsy and if we touch to focus it try to focus and gives good video but unfortunately its not working I think might be its the mistake of software, I would like to request INFOCUS team to fix it.  Overall its definitely a worth for money ,   I m loving it and Proudly says I m having Infocus m350 which is far better than most of the costly android mobile phones.

2284	An Android Fan	Jul 20, 2015	Yes	Great specs for the price range and I must say, I am impressed. Good buy for the price	I picked two of these for me and my wife as second phones and I am using these as encrypted phones for the mails. I see that they perform well, given the specs are great for the price point. Normally never trusted the cameras to be good at this price point but this phone surely has made me eat my words. Both the front and back have good reproductions and surely a handy one at that. The shutter is a bit slow but I am good with that.  It warms a bit on long usage but expected with large battery capacity in a small form factor. It surely has got strong reception even in basements. I am comparing it with my Motorola Nexus 6. Top of the line versus an entry phone. Unfair but it fares decent. The specs are better than Moto G2 which also I use and I would say, except for the Gorilla Glass (which I am making do with a screen guard), I would say it is competitively priced against the Moto G2.
2285	Om	Jul 20, 2015	Yes	Good to buy	It's a good prodtuct which fulfill all my need. In great that in that price range i got a good product with good hardware configuration. Will suggest to have & grab it.  Thank you spandeal for making it available & giving chance to get it.

2315	Andy	Jul 13, 2015	Yes	Good Phone at low price	The phone is good at price it is being offered.  The following are the pros and cons of the phone.  Pros:  1.  Very good phone at  price it is offered. 2.  Good build quality and gives a premium look 3.  Camera function is excellent and software for camera is very good. 4.   Battery back up is good last a day very easily after moderate usage 5.  Good screen protection  Cons  1.  Total size of phone is too big.  Its a 5 inch screen phone but gives the looks of 5.5 inch.  The front display panel is having infocus name branding on the front and it does not including any phone function.  2.   The navigation keys are on the screen. 3.  Only one sim slot is supported with 4 G connectivity another is 2g.
2316	Reju	Jul 13, 2015	Yes	Infocus M350 - Super Mobile	I purchased this through Snapdeal. I got the product within 3 days (appreciate for the service). It looks very nice and features are good. Good camera helps to capture clarity pictures.  One suggestion to the manufactures it's length is little over. Reduce the length from unused area (on bottom side). Totally, it is worth for value and I suggest this to all.
2317	Pozzo	Jul 13, 2015	Yes	A very efficient phone	The hardware is capable, the software promising - M350 shows a lot of promise in its price range.  Pros: >Very decent hardware with 64 bit cpu, LTE capability >2GB RAM >On Cell display, vibrant colors that pop-out at you >Signal strength so far has been quite good, same as call quality >The equiliser in M2 is missing here to be replaced by the stock one, but nevertheless the sound is rich, with proper players. >Speaker is just fine, not too loud, but not too low either >Asphalt 8, Run Forrest Run, Subway surfer runs just fine on MALI-T760 gpu >Back 8MP BSI camera is excellent, with details and vrich colors, so is the front 8MP camera.  Cons: >The UI is rich and promising but apparently has bugs, features lacking (Like auto startup manager- it sometimes hinders app running, unlike Asus Zenfone's) >Lacks screen protection (CG Glass 3/ AGC Dragontrail >Thick bezel at bottom unwieldy, lacks hardware touch buttons >Back cover too difficult to remove or reattach  All in all a very good buy, although the pricing could have been a bit less, maybe exclude the earphones which are average and reduce the overall price a bit more. I am very happy with my new all stylish, ultra-slim phone by InFocus.
2318	jay	Jul 13, 2015	Yes	Its perfect	I love it..i need backcover ..please available soon..lov u infocus 350...best mobile ever i used in my life..camera is nice..features are too good

2320	ray	Jul 13, 2015	Yes	M350 16 GB	Overall a nice phone for this price with all the functions .Some minor disadvantages are there those are common with android phones.Phone gets heated up,sound quality is not very loud have to put on full volume to hear music or while calling.The ringer is also quite low.But its ok for this price value for money
2321	saji v.t	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	best product in this range	good product,good internet speed,best clarity pictures, *******************************best quality auto focus camera
2322	Varun	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Good product however call quality needs improvement	I already had 2 Infocus products M2 and was quite impressed by the brand. No doubt this handset seems to be a master piece by looks and features like 8 Mp front and back camera, 2 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory and runs smooth with no lags. This was my 2nd order as i returned the first one coz of the issue of call quality and heating. The 2nd handset i got was good wit hall features however the call quality of incoming and outgoing calls was very average and not even good, when you have basic players like i ball, intex and micromax which offer best call quality with their features. So this is the only drawback i have observed within 3 days of the purchase.

2326	Saifu	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	In one word "A Masterpiece"	The phone has a nice build quality, has a premium back matte finish and metal lining, good specifications under budget category phones.  Regarding my experience with the device, I must say that the phone is lightweight, has decent viewing angles, good front and rear camera, bright display with smooth touch.  Moreover, I  didnt felt any lags as such with this device as the 2 Gb RAM works well while multitasking.  Also, the 2500 MAH battery provides a good battery back-up of more than a day with normal internet usage and gaming. The phone does not heat at all while gaming or charging.    However, this time too Infocus has not been able to manage more screen to phone ratio when compared to Yuphoria or Redmi 2. Secondly the earphone provided with the device is not of good quality.
2327	Ashok Kumar gupta	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Excelent......... Infocus M350 Best phone in this price range	This is my first smart phone  and i am using very easy way this phone so that i would say very good job in making this smart phone

About product: It is very handy and having good grip. Attractive too. Custom UI is confused first ,then feel useful. You may also select dual layer for default android view. I  Display: Awesome; many display options are available. On screen hot keys are confusing most of the times. getting home screen is difficult in hard situation. Double click to get opened application. single click leads to google and I hate this option. so disabled google. Call: Call clarity and speaker is good. Calling between sim is only available in dialer pad.Not able to call in particular sim after search from contacts. Default can be selected else each time it asks which sim to call. I like the option given in my last mobile, swipe to select sim easily. Also default search is not available in all tabs.I need improvement in dialer. Message: Sim selection is good. Camera:Front camera is excellent and rear camera is average. Out door picture is excellent. Rate:4.5/5 Broadcast: Pl. update your software to avoid continuous reception of message even after un-checking. Battery: Excellent. More than 24 hrs in average 3g or wifi use, RAM: 2GB. I am not experiencing any issues. Operation is as like 1 GB Ram. Atleat 900 MB is availabale for work. ROM: About 11 Gb avilable for us. 4G: After connecting 4g network, it is displaying as 3g. have to check this option.

2376	Celin	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	Simply Superb	To begin, absolutely  this was the mobile I was looking for awhile. With it's 2GB ram and 16GBrom it gives me enough space to download the apps & games I wanted to. The speed is good with it's 1.5 ghz processor. I'm happy with it's features. It's worth the price and I simply love it. It's from the very phone I'm typing this review. The keypad has both numbers and alp's on the screen . Which gives easy access to type fast. It simply fulfills my needs. All perfect and also from a best company and best dealers.
2377	Shashank	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	A true Value For MONEY....	I am using this phone from last three days.Got it from the preview sale.I am having a great time with this device.  It Being my third device I expected it to be perfect and it is doing its job pretty well.  It has a great selfie camera and the pictures don't get blurred even after zooming.It contains preinstalled apps which are perrty useful you just have to explore them.  the InLifeUI provided is not that heavyand has good user interface.But does not provides much customisation as that of MIUI of Xiaomi.  Gameplay is pretty smooth and I didn't faced any problems playing Asphalt 8. Casuals games like Subway Surf, Candy Crush are running smoothly.  The only problem that I faced was the battery which just lasted 10 hours while listening to 1 hours of music, playing games for 2 hours, 1 hour of browsing, half an hour of calling .  The bundled earphones are not that good.   PROS: Great front and rear cameras. Stunnig look. Great build quality. Does everything you throw at it. Very nice display with good viewing angles.  CONS: Not great battery backup. Not on the latest Lollipop OS. Charges slowly and take 2 Hours 45 min to get fully charged from 0 to 100% where fones like redmi 2, YU Yuphoria are coming with fast charging.
