7	Kapil	May 11, 2015	Yes	Good budget phone	Good phone in budget but the only problem is that it doest not have a vibration notification. I am not sure why this is done as this is something that should be part of the basic calling phone. I guess they can take some extra bucks but should probvide this feature.
