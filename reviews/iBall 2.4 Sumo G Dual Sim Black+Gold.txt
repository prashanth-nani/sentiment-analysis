I bought this cell for calling purpose apart from my smartphone which I don't use much for calling, I got this in good packing and got really amazed after opening box, it got all the basic features like torch wireless radio songs playback memory card option and hands free along with it.  Is feature still goes on like 3000 mah battery capacity.   The thing is I used this cell for calling and whenever I go to my time paas adda tea stall friends saw it and they liked the style for keeping such terrific battery phone for calling not even that tea wala guy and her friend also liked and told me to order 2 more handsets now they also enjoying wireless radio and playing movies in this cell and whenever I go for tea to that place they always thanks me for this cell, this cell worth every buck if your smartphone don't give you extra battery backup
