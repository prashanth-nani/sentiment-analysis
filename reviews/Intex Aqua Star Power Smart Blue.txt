3	Bh v satyanarayana	May 24, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	This mobile I bought 3 months back. But you people may surpise why I am writning the review now ? Because before that I bought 6 mobiles and given to others means my requirements not matching. After I bought this mobile I am not to watch any other mobiles now. You can understand this totally superb mobile. But only samll draw back is night time photos not much clarity.This is negligible requiremnt.
4	S Kumar	May 24, 2015	Yes	Value for Money	It is a nice phone in this price bracket. The screen size is also very good. The phone is faster in this segment of phones. Data handling capacity is good. Battery gives a considerable time to discharge. However, at times the bluetooth does not connect easily.
