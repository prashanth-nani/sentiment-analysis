4	Ramakrishnan R	May 03, 2015	Yes	Good Display	I am using first time in touch and android phone. In view of my basic mobile phone with this phone battery backup is not good, when i am browsing the internet the phone is shut down 3 to 5 hours. But internet connectivity speed is ok.  Pros: Touch is good, internet connectivity speed is ok back camera is a good and also good display. Pros: Battery backup is not good, front camera is not clear and voice is very low I am somewhat happy with this phone.
