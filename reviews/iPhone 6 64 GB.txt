1	Mrinal Mukherjee	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Seamless !!!	Every apple product is a one stop product , this being no less.I ordered it on 28th March , was delivered on the 31st , hence extremely satisfied with the delivery.Coming to the product , this piece is absolutely fantastic.Awesome display , Awesome Camera and Battery life.The only Con which i felt was that it generally heats up(occasionally) during charging , but then that's common with all the Apple Products. Final Verdict : Hell yes ! Go for it people ! its worth the buck ! Cheers Snapdeal ! Cheers Newgen Partners !

21	NeO	Mar 18, 2016	Yes	So Far So Good !!!	I am someone who loves and will always love Android to the core. But IPhone. Yes, thats something great. No lags, No heat, Superb GUI, Superb Feather touch. ITunes might check your patience initially. But its cool. Sophistication at its  best.  Snapdeal. Great, superb, as always.  The reason for my 4 star is that i got a minor dent on my back panel of IPhone. Well initially thought of replacing it. But then being an Indian thought that It was for my phones luck. Even the mighty moon has spots on it. So does my phone :D :D :D  Cheers.

107	Sanjay	Dec 13, 2015	Yes	Apple iPhone 6	Hi friends. I was not sure about online purchase of apple iPhone due to some assumptions about warranty and product quality. However when I saw the clear warranty term in snapdeal and 100 percent  quality assurance , I quickly decided to order one ..  Price was cheaper as compared to other portals and local shops.  Ordering process was seamless -5 out of 5.  Payment and acknowledgement - great without any issue.  Delivery of equipment-  before schedule.. I was surprised to see the very quick response and delivery from Hyderabad to mumbai.  Packing and product - very good. I got the best deal.  Thanks a ton for the service. Keep it up.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and

125	Neha	Nov 24, 2015	Yes	Amazing Experience	I so long wanted to grab iPhone 6 but half a lakh for a phone seemed unworthy till I got this deal with whooping 12K off.The phone is amazing especially if you work with emails a lot. Most importantly  the battery gets charged super quick and lasts me more than a day which is such a relief over my last android phone. Camera quality is another thing that will amaze you. This automatically improvise FaceTime or Skype for you. You will also reach for your DSLR much lesser now. The size of the phone also makes to its advantage I wonder how big iPhone 6 Plus must be if this is so large in size. It is sleek and beautiful looking. Overall a great experience so far and as they say if you do not have an iPhone you do not have an iPhone and now I have a good one.

140	Chugh	Nov 22, 2015	Yes	Valid warranty. Nice phone. Sub-par service by Snapdeal.	Not reviewing the phone here, as most of you would already know about it. I will try to clear some doubts here. Most people are sceptical of online purchases when it comes to Apple products. I've previously bought an iPhone (4S) from an authorized retailer + an ipod shuffle. I bought this phone near Diwali this year. Seller was H.K international.  My initial ordered was cancelled because it was out of stock with the first seller. Snapdeal transferred it to another Seller and absorbed the price. End Reslut: Delivery dates changed by 5 days. Delivery was within the revised promised dates - despite all my attempts to get it earlier (connected with Snapdeal several times). I must say that Snapdeal needs to work on logistics + service delivery. This is not to say their service is bad, its just worse than other new players (and yeah, you dont actually get a resolution unless you speak to the supervisors at the service desk, their juniors can ONLY share information, and nothing else).  Now to the phone, 1. Apple site says warranty for this phone is valid. Right from my date of purchase. 2. Phone is an Indian unit. Imported by Apple in India. 3. Phone was manufactured and imported in July. I bought it in the next 3 months. 4. Just for the sake of it, I called up Apple customer service and told them that I have doubts on my phones display. Told them I see it flicker sometimes. They asked me details and told me that I can take it to any Apple service centre - phone is covered under warranty. So I think, Warranty has no issues. (Off topic: One of the best customer service centre I've called - even better than Amazon - formal, yet friendly tones, they even asked me for my contact in case the call drops).   Reducing 1 star for the sub-par service by Snapdeal. I gave them an opportunity to shine, a moment of truth. They could've delivered it to me before time, did not. Painful because I have options. More biased towards Amazon after this incident. I still make small purchases on Snapdeal, but I know they wouldnt go an extra mile for me.
141	Abdul Mujeeb	Nov 19, 2015	Yes	Awesome Product!!	This is Apple product after all.. needs no introduction or review... love snapdeal's service quality and prices... loving the phone so far with absolutely no issues!!!

166	Bishesh	Nov 12, 2015	Yes	Thank you snapdeal	Well, I wont go on with reviewing Apple. But lemme tell you why I choose snapdeal for buying this product. This is the 2nd time I have bought a pricey cell phone from snapdeal, and the reason being the caution they show with the delivery of their products. My friend also bought this phone from a different seller and i can see the difference in packaging. Not only this, my snadeal courier guy waited patiently while i opened the package in front of him and it was only after that he asked for the cod payment. Besides this, i compared the price of this phone at a dozen of online stores while buying, and yes snapdeal had it at the lowest price, and even if some other sites were selling it at par with snapdeal price they were not having the 2 yr warranty. thank you for bringing a smile to my face by giving me a better deal everytime.
167	Anurag	Nov 12, 2015	Yes	Iphone 6 review	It is good. I m so happy by getting this phone from Snapdeal. Thank you so much Snapdeal.
168	Rakesh	Nov 12, 2015	Yes	Satisfied!	Fast delivery, excellent product! Recommended Anytime! If you don't have an Iphone, you dont have an Iphone!
169	ratan kumar	Nov 12, 2015	Yes	beautiful like every apple ...only backdrop is slippery	iPhone is iPhone. You cannot compare with other phones.   The only think I don't like is the phone is very slippery. my phone was mistakenly fall down thrice. Thank god. tempered glass protected it.   The phone is so thin. It is cynosure of all eyes. The space grey is good for men.   combine this with MacBook Air. You will receive calls in MacBook Air. Like I do regularly.   Now I have iPhone, MacBook Air and iPad.   Apple products are wonderful like seven wonders

176	Ethreee	Nov 09, 2015	Yes	Review from phoneguru 40 and counting age 25	The only phone you can never go wrong buying combined with SNAPDEAL price and special Prize
177	Kiran	Nov 09, 2015	Yes	Its an Apple product! Period!	Some confusion regarding the final seller of Snapdeal, but received a sealed product and on time.  True to expectations, iPhone 6 is a very good phone.  If you are investing in your first apple product, Iphone 6 is the perfect phone.  The prices have gone down and you will not be disappointed with it.  However, regarding exchange options, snapdeal washes its hand off and puts the transaction to a company called ReGlobe.  Its very surprising why Snapdeal chose this company.  An unethical / "cheap" company with obnoxious guys in the call center.  We need to first of all call them to pick up our old phone and also give them our address. This inspite of we receiving an sms from ReGlobe that the old phone will be picked up shortly. The guy who comes to pick up the old phone tries to negotiate the already confirmed amount.  Not that Rs. 500 would make a huge difference in selling your old phone, but the mannerisms and style of operations of  ReGlobe is just too "cheap".  I decided not to sell my old phone as they were not willing to pay me the confirmed amount and lo and behold, I get as sms from ReGlobe that they tried contacting me several times and did not get a response!  Days later I get a call from the call center and the guy asks me if the transaction is done!  While I am explaining the facts, he disconnects the phone. Just too "cheap" and its not even worth your time calling / discussing with them. Snapdeal should not endorse them.

320	Vish	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	Good and Genuine Product	Bought an item for the first time on snapdeal,  their service is good. The phone came in sealed box, when i opened the box the devices had some finger prints, so was a bit scared, there was no scratch. Probably the finger marks would be because of some quality checks done by snapdeal. Checked the device serial no on Apple website it was genuine, got activate without problem. So  i recommend it
321	Sachin	Oct 23, 2015	Yes	review	very nice product and very good serviced by snapdeal thank u very much to fulfilled my wish
322	Izzy	Oct 23, 2015	Yes	It's an iPhone!! I need not say anything more	Firstly, I'd like to commend Snapdeal for their speedy delivery. They delivered the phone to me in 3 days; much faster than expected. Now, coming to the phone. The screen is 4.7 inches, which i find to be just-the-right-size. The camera quality couldn't be any better. As for the memory, I thought I'd have issues since it's the 16GB model, but there were no issues even in that aspect. So, you just have to buy this phone - it's worth every rupee you spend on it.
323	Amit Jindal	Oct 23, 2015	Yes	Simply AWESOME product at an awesome price	I phone has always been one of my favorite But I didn't want to buy old models like iphone 4S, 5, 5C or 5S coz iPhone 6 and 6S has been one of the great phone with awesome specifications. But the only reason for not making the purchase was 'PRICE'. But all thanks to SNAPDEAL for taking care of people like me who want to buy brands like 'Apple' but price has always been a barrier. Snapdeal sale was like a music to my ears. When u explore the site, I was just shocked to see iPhone 6 at such an amazing price. I mean who was gonna miss that amazing deal. Price was too affordable as compare to actual price of iPhone 6. Frankly speaking, being a customer, I checked other sites in order to check whether any other e commerce portal was offering the product at same price!! But I was wrong. Only snapdeal was giving the same at such an affordable price. I immediately ordered the iPhone and waited for the product to be delivered. Within a few days, I got my long awaited iPhone(not to mention that I got proper tracking details as well from time to time in the form of SMS and e mail). I have been using the product from the time it was being delivered. It's awesome and  I have got no problem up till now. Well, frankly speaking, I was worried too as it was my first shopping experience on Snapdeal and that too while a sale. But Snapdeal just kept its promise. Its something you can trust upon.  GO FOR SNAPDEAL. IT VALUES YOUR MONEY

I got it at the best price on Snapdeal during this festive season and it's the best price one could get. Always wanted the gold color and I'm loving it.  I was tired with bugs on Android apps and therefore switched to iOS, which is great in every way. iPhone 6 is very responsive and despite having just 1 GB RAM it's very well optimized.  Pros -Camera quality is unmatched- both front and rear -Very responsive touch, works like magic -Siri is now very advanced, although some improvements required it's far better than Google Now -16 GB is just fine for me, but for those who click pics and selfies every minute can consider 64GB -Awesome resolution and great audio quality -I don't miss android anymore  Cons - Is expensive even than flagship Android - Storage isn't expandable,  but this is how Apple make money

This is a genuine phone as I have verified it's serial number from Apple's website.  Apple iphone 6, well... it doesn't need my testimony. The product speaks for itself.  Simply Amazing!!  Suggestion to Snapdeal : Ecom express delivered this courier on time but they never update their delivery status. What is the point of having a "check delivery status" column when it is never been updated?  anyways... I am happy with the both the service and the product...

655	Rajman	Sep 30, 2015	Yes	Truly made my 'Dil ki deal' !!	It was sceptical in the beginning to depend on snapdeal for buying an iphone. Heard a lot about post delivery issues with many other e-commerce portals  with respect to iphones like used phones, faulty products,etc. Still decided to go ahead with my buy with snapdeal owing to the brilliant pricing and hordes of positive reviews from other buyers for the same product.                         Product was delivered within 3 days and overall service is great. Very reliable and timely delivery. The product packaging was perfect and the phone is top class, works like a charm. Utilized the 'old product selling' option with snapdeal though the quote for the old phone was below my satisfaction levels and there is no point in expecting good rates. Its better to try olx or direct delling options outside, i feel.   Thank you snapdeal, for an outstanding buying experience ! Truly recommendable !!
656	Arpit	Sep 30, 2015	Yes	I phone 6	Phone is very good and packing was also gud that product was not damage in this case

663	Niko	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	An Android User's Review of the iPhone 6:Read this if you are thinking of switching from Android!	Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise): 1. Camera. The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone. Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone. This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone. (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user. Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).  2. Reliability. There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices. On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else. Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.  3. Fingerprint sensor. Once you've used it, you won't go back. The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor. The one in the iPhone 6 works really well. I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.  4. Control of apps. This is an interesting point. In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS. But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera. In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.  5. Double tap to bring down the row of apps. I can't believe no one has thought of this before. A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that. You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.  Here are the things that I miss on Android: 1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps. I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that. I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).  2. Better email. In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone. You can't do that on Apple. You can't even attach a single file. You have to share a file as an email. So, forget about replying an email with an attachment. This is pretty annoying.  3. Productivity is better on Android. If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app). You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected. It's so seamless. Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines). So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app. It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.  4. Notifications are way better. Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications? You have to individually close each app's own notification. I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.  5. Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri. Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one. More customization and etc.  Conclusion: Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one. The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg. I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for.
664	Sapna	Sep 29, 2015	Yes	Thank you snapdeal	I received the product before the expected time. It was packed well.

708	MUST BUY PHONE	Sep 24, 2015	Yes	A MUST HAVE PHONE FOR ALL.....WHO HAS THE BUDGET, HANDY, CUTE, EXCELLENT	VERY COMPETITIVE PRICE, ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PHONE...........SNAPDEAL HAS ONE OF THE BEST AND EASY WAY TO PURCHASE AND EXIT QUICKLY
709	Khilan	Sep 24, 2015	Yes	If its not an iPhone it's not an iPhone	That tagline holds completely because an iPhone is so simple to use and always a classy device to have in your pocket. The bending myth about the phone is totally vague and absurd. The iPhone has aircraft grade aluminium on its back. I am an outdoor Businessman and it is highly durable. If you buy a phone then go for an iPhone. Do not look at the price. It is always worth to buy an iPhone rather than a Samsung device which starts lagging in a year of use.
710	Nivasrao22	Sep 24, 2015	Yes	iPhone 6 16gb	Good sallar & fast delivery  nice one  Iam satisfied
711	Feroz	Sep 23, 2015	Yes	Good Price	A very good price comparing to other online stores.
712	mitesh mutha	Sep 23, 2015	Yes	Typically slick, the best iPhone yet	The products just blew me off. It is a fantastic piece of creation from Apple. Before I sound too obsessed with my Apple I-Phone 6, let me straight away tell you why. Android as a platform from Google has become a rage and being used as free universal platform. But off late it has been exposed to a number of threats and security flaws. The different versions are tweaked and their operating codes are easily accessed. Apple I phone is difficult to crack in that sense. Its software is more robust and comes with an exclusive range of features which separates you from the masses. I think Apple I phone is every worth of the penny it costs. I recommend Apple I- phone to all the mobile users who have advanced smart phone needs and wants to separate them from the herd mentality. Some of the key features of this beautifully designed phone are the gold texture, the 64 Gb internal memory which is quite adequate for all sorts of storage applications. Its 1 Gb ram and an 8 megapixel camera give a superior experience. What brings success for Apple I-phone 6 and is a game changer is the iOS 8, Dual-Core 1.4 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based) Processor which provides superior graphics to the device. This dual core processer speed is visible when multiple applications are being played on the device. I found the switching between applications to be extremely smooth.please note the ios9 update has increased battery life upto 50% As soon as you will get this device you will be hooked on to it and will love to flaunt it.

Have been using the iPhone for  a week now, it is a great feeling and a great deal. Pray to God that it never malfunctions. Although got the best pricing from SnapDeal.

725	somendra	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	awesome product	there is no comparison between iPhone and android devices. people keep saying that iPhone is better or android phones are better just want to say that both are awesome but both are using a different operating system i am not a fan boy of iphone but the operating system is different which don't a big ram to run any program its enough to run all application of iOS.   Things i like on iPhone:- 1) Heat less in compare of my android device ( Mi4 ) 2) You can run multiple task at same task without lag games or program. 3) Sleek Design and its weight is also very less. 4) Finger Print Scanner i know other devices have this features but non work like this.  There are many other features and con there but i am not here for that just want to write small review.   Thank You

813	Amlan	Sep 10, 2015	Yes	If you want something that just works then this is the best	Have been a long time android loyalist so this review is as impartial ad it gets. Thanks to SD for getting it to me before time and in a very safe manner  Pros 1. It just works...  No long setups, no complicated settings, no fumbling around to find that small button for opening options. It guides you beautifully from the get go and stuff just starts working 2. Smooth as butter. I've used the best android phones and nothing compares  3. Itunes, although a pain is much better than a lot of android phone managers  4. Amazing cam, don't let the 8MP fool you, the pictures would put a lot of cameras to shame   Cons  1. Why do i have to save my credit card info if i use only free apps  2. Why itunes do you want to convert my songs and videos when the phone can play most formats  3. The pesky sim opener thing is going to get lost  Had to really stretch to get some cons, might just make me an apple supporter

The phone is very handy, can store whatever I like, takes absolute;ly phenomenal pics, is speedy in action, does not hang on any game and with multiple applications open. The battery life is much better than 5s but it could have been still better as mine does not last one full day still with a heavy usage.  Service from snapdeal was perfect like always, one day delivery, good packaging.  Very happy to buy this from snapdeal - it was best price that I received versus market.

On Apple website to check its authenticity. And it was perfect :) thanks Snapdeal for delivering not just the product but an awesome experience. One thing I wanna raise through this platform that I have given the invoice on the name of 'Siddhartha' (my friend'/ name)which I want to update on the name of Jatin sharma (my name)

928	Animesh	Aug 29, 2015	Yes	Absolutely Fabulous!	Awesome phone. Beautiful industrial design, super-sleek, smooth edges - a beauty to hold in hands - the feel of the phone itself is so very different.  Software completely gels with the hardware. Beautiful interface, all apps have such a different, elegant design - even the most widely-used Android ones, too. Just a couple of examples, Google Playstand looks much more elegant, works with much more finesse on the iOS than even on its own Android OS; WhatsApp is a beauty to behold on the iPhone.  Yes, it does take a few hours to get used to Apple's way of doing things coming from the Android / Windows Phone background (I come from a MotoX and a Lumia 1520 background); but once you get the hang of it - you'll never ever even cast a glance at any other phone/OS/ecosystem.  Just three words to summarize: Simple, Elegant, Beautiful.

Which never giving the monster processor,a monster ram,an infinite pixel camera but why Apple because of it reliability and software/ hardware.In terms of speed and Quality of software,it's way ahed from any other smart phone in the market.Because this is one device which shows you how much can be done with how little of it.And it's the name a brand larger than the life one and only...

1029	Sanyaldk	Jul 16, 2015	Yes	It's iPhone!  Best buy as snapdeal	Do I need to write a separate review for an iPhone?  It's already well established  brand and if you want smooth n consistent  performance apple has to be your choice.  I have also used best of other brands. like Samsung note 4, it's exceptional in its own arena of fable but camera has some issues. The new s6 is close to iPhone 6!  Thus iPhone with its consistent performance stands as a winner.  About new design, I loved the full metal design. After adding a cover I don't feel it's slippery and feels good in hand. With iOS9 there will be further enhancement in is experience.  About hardware, the camera is one the best in all available smartphones. The speakers are placed perfectly  so as to not block the sound. The internal specs are powerful to perform any task you will throw at it. overall satisfying experience. The smoke gray color appease superior.  And finally thanks to snapdragon for delivering it within time. Great experience.

1199	Sudarshan	Jun 09, 2015	Yes	Best phone ever for businessman, professionals, individuals	Bought iPhone 6 64 GB through snapdeal. It has amazing mobile and has good features. Pros: 1. Fantastic design and screen size. Neither big as tablet nor small as iPhone 4 or 5. 2. Super kool touch. Everything is feather touch. 3.  100% no hanging or slow. 4. Elegant design. 5. Improved battery backup than iPhone 5S. 6. Best packing done by snapdeal seller and item received as promised in time.  As soon as I got my mobile I have ordered Rock bumper for this phone both came same day, I have put bumper and took to mobile accessory shop to add glass screen guard for screen and normal screen guard for back. My phone is very elegant now. Cons: 1. If you buy an iPhone now you will buy an iPhone in future. Because you cannot manage with any other mobile.  I used Samsung note 2 later sold and took iPhone 5S used for about 1.5 year and I jumped to iPhone 6. Didn't even bother to look at other phones. 2. It's eye catcher so be vigilant from thieves.

1224	DexterPrashant	Jun 08, 2015	Yes	It's an IPHONE n its PERFECT but with design issues	This is my 2nd iPhone and first one to buy online. I'm an Apple enthusiast, so this was an obvious choice for me.  Overall, the phone is awesome. It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc. The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 90% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.  There are a few shortcomings, however: 1. The protruding rear camera lens is just stupid - so you really can't set the naked phone on its back without worrying about it. 2. The rolled edges on the glass are just stupid - this means that a screen protector cannot go edge to edge. It also means that most any case will have a gap between it and the glass at the eye of the case. 3. Too thin - yes, this phone is too thin - hence the protruding rear camera issue. Thinness also contributes to making the phone very slippery and very easy to drop. Maybe that is what Apple wants - drop the phone often so you have to replace it often? 4. Confounding the thinness issue are the rounded edges. Rounded edges make many cases very easy to slip off, or at least not fit as snug as they otherwise could. 5. Not case friendly: Thin + round edge + rolled glass edges = a very unfriendly phone to accepting cases and screen protectors. Overall, I find the iPhone 5/5s much easier to fit a case to it and install a screen protector.  but iPhone 6 is a very cool device. For everyday use like email and Internet, I really do not notice any speed difference, but some web pages open slightly faster. Buy this phone for increased screen size. I like the screen size, but would probably have bought a smaller (normal?) screen if they made that - the added size does make it a bit less "pocketable." The 6+ seems like it would be too large for most folks - where do you carry it? I ended up with the bumper case, BTW, and it seems to work out fine and is very protective and still fits in my back pocket, shirt pocket, or cargo-pant pocket (I drop my phone a lot, so it suits my needs).  I use it for work, play, investing and checking stocks, pictures, video, texting, notes, to-do list, play guitar with iRig, music, emergency flashlight, reading news, reading Kindle books, watching YouTube and Amazon instant video, running apps, hands-free phone in car, and the list goes on and on. What other purchase on the planet enables so many things to be done with it? A smart phone is a no-brainer, really. So, at this point I will always have an iPhone. And my father and brother have iPhones too. Just so convenient on so many levels and essential to stay in touch in a busy lifestyle. Pictures do seem crisper with this phone. You can't go wrong with this device. Period.  But that does not mean it is perfect - the physical deficiencies I have noted, IMHO, are a step backwards for this device, performance aside. The protruding camera, really, by today's standards and by Apple's design theme of sleekness, is just stupid and very unexpected. But, at the end of the day, it is an iPhone and functionally it does exactly what I have come to expect it to do..

1275	Saloni	Jun 04, 2015	Yes	Great Phone at a great Price	My I Phone 6 was a birthday gift from my hubby. To tell you the truth it was a dream come true for me. I was already using an I Phone 4 so although technically only an upgrade but the feel of new phone was really astounding. The I 6 has everything a person can expect from a hand device. An exceptional speed, clarity, ease of use, thoughtful features and the legendary design besides killer looks. The best part was the great price at which my husband bought it from Snapdeal. The phone was delivered in 2-3 days, it came in original packing and with warranty at a 20% discount ... Thanks hubby dear and Snapdeal

It's response time is very fast.  Though there few concerns like sharing files/ doc to other device is not very convenient. App size is much higher than android. feature like call / SMS through sliding left / right on list of contact is very convenient in android. From contact list sms is not possible , if mobile no is saved other than mobile tag. As it is very intelligent it should recognize through mobile no format.  Overall product is good.

1351	sunny	May 26, 2015	Yes	price good	Good price
1352	ANSH	May 24, 2015	Yes	PRODUCT IS GOOD HERE IS MY HANDS ON REVIEW	The iPhone 6 delivers a spacious, crisp 4.7-inch screen, improved wireless speeds, better camera autofocus, and bumped-up storage capacities to 128GB at the top end. iOS remains a top-notch mobile operating system with an excellent app selection, and Apple Pay is a smooth, secure payment system. CON  Battery life isn't much better than last year's iPhone 5S. An even larger screen could have been squeezed into the same housing. For Android owners who once jumped ship from iOS and want to come back, this is the iPhone generation you've been waiting for. It's the best iPhone since the iPhone 5. Back then, 4G LTE and an improved screen and camera made the difference. This time, a larger screen, a fast processor, NFC with Apple Pay (although likely only that), the additional customization features of iOS 8, and bumped-up storage tiers go a long way to close the feature gap with current top Android phones.  For hard-core Android fans, well, there are Android phones that cost less, have higher-resolution screens (and screens even larger than the 6 Plus), boast better battery life, have removable SD card storage, and even removable batteries. And the Android camp has an all-new operating system, too, with Android 5.0 Lollipop. You won't find any of these on an iPhone 6; you can't have everything in Apple-land. That said, the larger screens of the new iPhones combined with iOS 8's bevy of familiar customization features make the 6/6 Plus the most attractive iPhone generation yet, and the most tempting to Android owners in years

The order was for a gold coloured iPhone 6, though I was delivered a smoky grey, though I was more than happy. Product is new, edge over the best smart phones. A shirt literature with specifications & how to start would have been helpful. Nothing to guide the first time iPhone user.  Like all snapdeal products, I was kept informed about the product. The detailed description too was very helpful & guided well with the reviews of previous customers. Reasons to recommend Snapdeal to others is many. Huge range of products, best offers & deals!! Keep it up!!

1450	Rohit the whatever	May 16, 2015	Yes	Product is excellent but I was misled by snapdeal	I bought this product when there was an offer which stated that I'd get one year extended warranty via warranty bazar. I confirmed about the same from their executives. The price was competitive, plus I was getting an extended warranty. So I was very happy with my purchase. But later on, even after complying properly with the terms and conditions of the product, I didn't get an extended warranty. I've contacted both, snapdeal and warranty bazar quite a number of times but they seem to be manipulating me. Product is excellent. Service from snapdeal isn't.

1482	Khush ghuman	May 09, 2015	Yes	Six sigma	It was a honour to buy a product from this esteemed brand. There were misconceptions in the mind while purchasing such a costly product. As it was heard frm some people that these online retailers dnt give u the right product u will nt get indian warranty ur accessories in the box will nt be orignal bla bla bla.. Bt finally i made my mind to purchase this product and the everything which i got was better than a shop keeper. I got it at best price available in the market and got one year warranty from waranty bazaar and was delivered in least expected time. One thing more i misplaced the bill and i put a mail to snapdeal and these people replied me back with orignal bill in 3-4 hrs. It was an excellent experience. i wish this company get to the expectations of other customers also. I wish u a bright future fr the company and employees.  Thanks Snapdeal

JUST PERFECT PHONE IN MY LIFE till NOW.

1507	Sumesh	Apr 29, 2015	Yes	it's really a awesome phone as i used it	Apple iPhone 6: it's really a awesome phone as i used it.  However when i ordered, unfortunately i received a defective product (Not a Snapdeal fault as you can't blame snapdeal for the faulty product as packing was intact). After spending some time with the phone, when i noticed  this i simply called Snapdeal customer support number and they replaced the product.  Really appreciate the services provided to me by Snapdeal. As when someone is spending 50k buck from his/her pocket, he/she must be worried if something like this happens.  Thank You Snapdeal for the best Services towards your customers.  Sumesh Sharma
1508	sujatha	Apr 29, 2015	Yes	Its awesome I got the best deal	Before ordering I have bit confusion bez of seeing others review but once i got the order I have totally loved snapdeal service. I like to prefer snapdeal and there quick delivery

1513	Luvya	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	Very Nice Product	Hi, This was a really very nice experiance with Snapdeal to purchase Apple I Phone. The product was also too nice. I really like the pricing of this product at  Snapdeal which is really amazing. In addition of this delivery timeline is also very fine. I always suggest my friend to go thru the Snapdeal before buying anything from any other source. Thanks!
1514	Zoher	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	I cant just live without i!t	I have purchased Apple iPhone 6 and I am very happy! I am a blind user and also tried Android system but IOS is amazing as it provides a complete accessibility in form of screen reader called Voiceover. It looks like a mobile phone in compare to its predecessor iPhone 5s like a paper wait due to its curved edges. The only 2 drawbacks it has 1. Average battery life the battery  does not last more than 15 hours 2.  The buttons of touch key board which are on the edge of phone like A Q P ECT. Are difficult to get It should have been placed little in side of the curved screen.
1515	Don_quixote	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	A rotten apple	Nah!! Dont go by the headline. It is actually a great phone to hang out with. Yes i had to sell my kidneys to this 5" thingy but i think its better to have a thing that you can show off. LOL. Had apple went on with adding wireless charging i would have bought it for all my family members. There nothing but the launching date to be told to a big APPLE fan!
1516	First-time user of iPhone	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	Great phone, intuitive interface, very reliable operation	Bought iPhone 6 16 GB Space Grey through Snapdeal in Jan 2015. My experience with the product for last 4 months has been great. Here are the highlights: 1) Interface is very intuitive, it feels very seamless while operating. User effort is optimized to peform various tasks. 2) Highly reliable - I have not experienced even one instance of malfunction with the instrument so far in 4 months. It just works and gives output as expected. I feel very secure with my data and important transactions like banking and other commercial transactions. 3) The display is superb and shows detail and clarity in every frame. Colors of pictures look very real-life. Its like a little computer you are always carrying with you and it has drastically reduced my frequency of using my laptop at home. On the negative side, I do not find all apps which are iOS compatible. People tend to make apps first for android and then for iOS, which puts limits on your use of the phone.
1517	raj	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	Awsome product	product is 100% orignal. Thanks to snap deal

1527	Sharad Jain	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	If you don't have an iPhone, well you don't have an iPhone !	Having read and heard a lot about the con's of ordering iPhone or per say any other Mobile online, (especially cases of mobiles being brick once purchased from SD), I was a bit sceptical. However, I have always maintained SD being one of the best e-commerce portal, can't indulge in these can't kind of lowly activities. And must say my faith in SD (well lot to thanks to Aamir khan honestly for building more confidence), proved to be right!!! A steal deal from SD saved me at least 6k and Mobile which I received was in top notch condition. Thanks SD for proving me right and GUYS GO FOR IT!!!
1528	Gagansehgal	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	i would buy this product again	Very good product
1529	prat	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	best except	it's best except  battery backup not good enough for 3G network  speaker output not very good  limited software available plus have to pay for many software which r free on net
1530	jainam	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	perfect product	People say that the online purchasing is fraud..i had experienced that the best place to shopping is online only...and i always purchase on the snapdeal only...and i have full faith on it .....i buyed iphone 6 and it is the best product which i have recived from snapdeal ....snapdeal give the low price every thime...thanks

1533	Ajit	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	Iam happy with the services of Snapdeal	Before buying this product I checked with the Apple care and they informed that they cannot give guarantee for the product which we buy from Snapdeal. But the product which I got is genuine and you can fully trust on the product you buy from Snapdeal. Since Snapdeal charges the lowest price on all the products you buy from them.
1534	Siddharth	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	Apple iPhone 6	After a month of use  Pros Awesome Looks Light Weight Good Battery Amazing Camera Good for Selfies  Cons: Not pocket friendly.  Overall Apple proved why they r best in the World. Happy to have Iphone 6
1535	ashok	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	great product	Authentic product in perfect working condition.  Properly sealed with all parts intact.  Available at discounted price in comparison to market price. Extremely satisfactory performance. And I was glad the colour of my choice was available. I would highly recommend this phone and do check the imei number of invoice and box for warranty authenticity.
1536	Himanshu	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	Great	If you are already an iPhone user, you may find this iPhone a bit large to hold initially, but still it is really much more than an iPhone.
1537	Nasru	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	Brand/Build Quality/Performance/Price	I have been an Android user for over 6 years now. I was confused whether to migrate to iOS or not. Am very happy that i decided to do that. This phone is a BEAST and the brand itself says it all. Amazing built quality and it freaking fast (A8 chip). Camera excellent, Battery very good  The only drawback in my opinion that it is very slim. You may  want to put case on.
1538	Saurav	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	Good Price, Great phone..!!	This is the best deal.. I went to several shops & most of them were charging me 5k more than the price mentioned on Snapdeal. Most of the local resellers told me that Snapdeal would be selling me Grey market iPhone which would not be eligible for warranty in India. This bothered me a bit & hence I called Snapdeal. The operator assured me that the product would be valid Indian Purchase eligible for warranty in India & also told me that if I face any problems with Warranty, Snapdeal will help me get it done. Also the Snapdeal agent told me that I could return the product in 7 days after receiving the product & I would be given a complete refund of whatever I pay. This was very comforting to hear & hence I placed the order.   To my surprise the Phone was delivered to me in one day. The packaging was great & the box was factory sealed. I took the IMEI number & called apple support before opening the box who told me that the device is eligible for warranty in India & the warranty was activated as soon as I activated the device. Overall a great experience & a great purchase.

1541	Zoheb	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	AWESOME EXPERIENCE!!!!	I bought Apple iPhone 6 ... Yeah Snapdeal gives you the best deal on this planet  !!!! Loads of Love to Snapdeal. Even their Customer Care are Avengers.. Smooth delivery ... No Fictions only Solutions ... Thanks
1542	Apple-boy	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Don't think twice...just go for it!	product was superb....apple takes nothing for granted. It's something special, not a tinge of ordinary. the phone was setup as its expected. the process is so easy and smooth. iOS is fully lag free and TRUST ME (even thou I'm a stranger) there's nothing like it.  However my iphone had a few glitches. the network strength was fluctuating; Bluetooth was not pairing right; touchscreen did hang once. Apple Phone Support did help in resetting the phone yet some things didnt feel right. All this happened within 5days of purchase. So I decided to ask for a replacement, too early for these glitches...scares me about the future.  However please don't judge the iphone by these few bugs, happens in a few pieces always....their full replacement warranty is there for us consuers.   To end justly I will be short and simple...a phrase for my entire short experience "If you don't have an iphone, You don't have an iphone"   WAY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SMARTPHONE!!!!!
1543	The Jag Watcher	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Amazing phone!	Absolutely amazing phone! A must have for Apple fans. Sleek, easy to use and light. High quality cameras and interface. Touch is fantastic and display is as Apple as ever! The design is slightly larger than the conventional iPhone and won't fit easily into a small pocket. The battery lasts about a day on moderate usage. Overall this is a great phone and I am happy with it. Silver looks the best, elegant and suave.
1544	Sandeep Nagpal	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	I phone 6....	No one can give you price and heavy discounts on i phone except sd  wonderful packing fast delivery  i love it

1548	varun	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Perfect product ,Pathetic gift wrap	The product is top noch, superior quality product  Snapdeal delivery was in time and the outer packing was good too. BUT .. this was the first time i asked for gift wrapping with the 30 Rs additional charge and it was highly disappointing, the wrapping paper was poor quality and the way it was wrapped was even worse.Thank god i did not directly deliver the product to the receiver of the gift.  I would definitely recommend this product with snapdeal , but would not recommend the gift wrap option.
1549	Guest	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Absolutely Stunning	Fantastic Phone as well as features.

1552	Mickey	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Best Product	When its apple it has to be best. This is my 4th iphone and its always better than its successor. Decent screen size (larger than before) makes easier to view documents and emails.
1553	Rahul	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Great phone	As every apple phone, this is an easy to use phone with a great camera.....very light. I have been using it for a few months now and nothing negative to say.
1554	FF	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Brillant Phone !!	Iphone 6 is a super phone, very easy to use !!
1555	Bhatia	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Apple i-phone the True Smart Phone	What more could you want from a Smart Phone than what Apple's new iPhone 6 offers you. One of the most intelligent smart phone which mankind uses today with unlimited features, you ask it, It has it. Now the main part is getting it at the right price, I was wanting to buy it from past one month and was carefully tracking the price on various e-retailer sites, But just like Singh is king there is Only one King in E-retail in India and that is "SNAPDEAL" Of-course. I really got it at a STEAL Thanks Snapdeal, if it wasn't you I still would be thinking to buy or not to buy.
1556	gk	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Stylish talk	Internationally recognized product at an unimaginably low price..
1557	g r p	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Excellent	We also buy any product this site

1559	Dhaval	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Great phone and fast service.	I have always been a apple customer (wouldn't have it any other way) But this phone is GREAT! so much bigger and slimmer than the 5s. I really did not see a whole lot of difference from the 5s. But I think if you was upgrading from a 4 to a 6 then you would really see the difference.   As a long time iPhone user, the iPhone 6 doesn't disappoint. The size is an upgrade over the previous models and the phone feels great in the hand.  And not to forget, excellent service by snapdeal!
1560	Harikrish	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	I Phone- Awesome phone in all time	I love it, very thin and very light!!!

Waiting for Apple watch launch in India. One suggestion,  Snap deal should improve the image quality in iOS app, its very blurry on home screen.
1564	Naman	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	Nice phone at great price	Nice phone with great features,soo much to explore, though siri works not that great but then too a nice gadget to have. Sleek design make it more elegent but less sturdy.

1580	@ankush	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Great Phone but Battery Drains Fast	Great Phone but Battery Drains Fast if the network is not good and even on Wifi it drains fast , so please take care
1581	Manas	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Another awesome product from Apple	Snapdeal's delivery is very slow. It took me an order cancellation and a re-order to get this product. It only reached to me on the estimated delivery date. Packing was very poor, the box was not even wrapped in any bubble wrap, just a cardboard box around the phone box.  From product perspective- despite all these problems phone was unharmed and is running in perfect harmony. Good looks, good performance and awesome user experience. It just can't get any better. Immediate update to latest iOS 8.3. Touch ID is working better than iPhone 5S. Some OS features like shortcuts to recent calls, facetime, apple watch integration and health app gives a very good experience.  Camera is way better and so far the best from Apple. With good apps you can take pro quality pictures.  Performance is just smooth even if you are playing a game, and skype is on with other messanger apps are constantly pinging.  On a single recharge Battery runs easily for 1.5 days with Data and location ON all the time.  Seems like heating problem from iphone 5 has also been rectified with this phone.  Only reason to go for another phone is if you are a hardcore fan of Android or windows.  If budget allows, just go for it.
1582	Anwar	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Good Phone, Good Price	Very Good phone, Better price Touch is always awesome with Apple. Over all good experience with Snapdeal now.
1583	Roma	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Safe & Reliable Way to Buy Products	2 months back i have purchased an IPHONE 6 from Snapdeal,it is running with very good condition...I have also recommended my Brother to purchase iphone 6 only from snapdeal since ..no other online website could provide iphone at such lowest price...and the cost is also very low comparing to the showroom price and quality of products are remarkable and absolutely outstanding.Snapdeal is a very reliable supplier. I am a regular customer of it aint it not only provides "Lowest in the Market" pricing but also have a very efficient after sales service. Buying anything from snapdeal and it wont upset you.Snapdeal is one of the best e-commerce websites to buy stuff with real value for your money.One can get best deals on Snapdeal which most of the times are not available in the near by outlets in their place. The products sold are brand new and 100% genuine. So there is ambiguity in the quality of products. The product purchased are delivered within 2-3 business days and also replacement for faulty products within 30 days of notification is provide...Isse Sasta or acha or kaha :)
1584	Tejas Munees S	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Awesome.. Not saying as an Apple fan.. But the product is really worth it. Don't believe your guts so as to buy 128GB.... 64GB is more than sufficient. I thought what if I may need, but went for 64GB, I am not regretting. The product is great. Initially sometime while using for the 1st or 2nd time, it may heat up as happened to me, but don't worry, it isn't the case later. The product overall is a gold. Apple as usual males its consumers in a very comfort zone by making user friendly product. A definite buy if money is not the problem.
1585	Ashi1428	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	simple elegant beautiful smart	apple devices are top-notch in every aspect, graphics, performance, battery life, apps, build quality. I is a very light weight phone. Also the aspect ratio is very ideal. No very big not very small. Once you use iOs device you will not thing of using anyother
1586	Akhil Saxena	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Best iPhone till date	I had heard a lot of good and bad things about this phone. So, I bought the space grey version to find out myself. This phone is a epitome of
1587	Munees	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Excellent Product	Awesome.. Not saying as an Apple fan.. But the product is really worth it. Don't believe your guts so as to buy 128GB.... 64GB is more than sufficient. I thought what if I may need, but went for 64GB, I am not regretting. The product is great. Initially sometime while using for the 1st or 2nd time, it may heat up as happened to me, but don't worry, it isn't the case later. The product overall is a gold. Apple as usual males its consumers in a very comfort zone by making user friendly product. A definite buy if money is not the problem. Also the shipment was excellent and in time.
1588	Nitzeous	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Great phone!	After owning Android devices for 5 years, I tried using iOS device for the first time and I went with iPhone 6 (64GB, space grey). The following is what I felt: Pros:  1. Straight out of the box, the device looked BEAUTIFUL! It felt really well crafted. 2. The operating system is very easy to learn and there is nothing complicated about it. The fact that it offers very less options to customize kind of works as a pro also. 3. The phone's battery is fairly good and gives 24+ hours of backup. 4. The touch, fingerprint scanner, speaker are all great and are exact quality of what an Apple product should be. 5. Great camera for daylight photography!  Cons:  1. Can't really customize much but that's what iOS is all about. 2. The phone is slippery which can often make it fall. 3. The glass is not that strong and the phone itself feels like a piece of jewellery which you have to care a lot about.  Overall: I am happy with the purchase but I wouldn't purchase another iPhone unless they fix the OS and make it stronger. Also, it doesn't do justice to the price.
1589	Rahul	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Excellent Product	Can't get better than this. The product - the price and the delivery were all excellent. Worth the money. Please go for it.
1590	ssingh	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	iphone 6	i bought iphone 6 and checked its warranty from apple id online. Product delievered is good and has warranty shown on apple site. However it took long to deliever the product after order.

1592	Shahbaz khan	Apr 16, 2015	Yes	Amazing phone, and quick delivery	The price for the phone was amazing. Got the delivery in one day. It was amazing experience of online shopping for such an expensive item
1593	P3	Apr 16, 2015	Yes	Excellent product..but	I think reachability is an issue .. Otherwise touch as usual is awesome ..but  iPhone 6 is too delicate which was not the case earlier iPhones But otherwise bigger screen gives you better gaming experience. And as usual snapdeal gave timely delivery
1594	rko	Apr 16, 2015	Yes	Best Iphone till date...	Brilliant product from Apple. Upgraded from Iphone 5 and was apprehensive about the screen size. But its a killer phone. Looks: Amazing sleek design, this is the thinnest iPhone till date. And bending issues were definitely overrated. Brilliant screen and display. It simply is the best looking device from Apple in recent times. Performance: The Iphone 6 is a strong performer. 1) The first noticeable improvement is the battery life. I use it extensively for gaming and other apps on both 3G/Wifi yet it has more than a days battery life. Definitely an improvement over the old ios devices. 2) The second major improvement is its camera. Iphone 6 and 6+ have the best smart phone cameras period.
1595	Tajeshwar singh	Apr 16, 2015	Yes	Best QUALITY products from SNAPDEAL.	This is my second phone from SANPDEAL, and I can;t tell you how much happy i'm by getting it from Snapdeal.

1607	JP	Apr 15, 2015	Yes	Fine service is an under statement!	Iphone 6 was a long cherished dream and finally, I was about to buy the same, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the online purchase or physically buy it from the store.   However, given the price quoted in Snapdeal and based on my past experience, I decided to go with Snapdeal only.   Though, I wanted to opt for express delivery mode; since it was not available, I went ahead with standard delivery option only.    Although I really hoped for it to deliver before the week sets in. And to my surprise, it was delivered dot on time in 3 working days.   Thank you Snapdeal. I wish you a much brighter future by reaching out to millions with finer services day after day.

1610	abhi	Apr 15, 2015	Yes	Nice phone	IPhone 6 is termed to be the best iPhone launched but I feel that my previous phone which was Nexus 5 was much better is web browsing and in responsive time. IPhone is more of a style statement then anything. Android phones are much better value for money. Few good things about iPhone 6 is that the voice quality, speaker and of course the camera.

1662	ravi	Mar 31, 2015	Yes	Iphone is best	The product is genuine and good, but tracking of shipment is worst and there is no proper update. This is not first time in snapdeal, whenever I buy a product it is the same case, so try to make it more appropriate.

1664	advait	Mar 31, 2015	Yes	Brand New Product Delivered	First of all, i was a little wary that given the lower price that Snapdeal offered compared to others, I might be getting some surprise with the Product. But my expectations were belied, it was a sealed brand new apple iPhone 6 that I had received as per the color and specifications that I had ordered. The phone got auto registered for 1 year warranty after I set it up.  Cons: Delivery took around a week, and the delivery status showed that the product was lying packed for pickup and took longer for that than in the actual delivery. Customer Service also needs lot of improvement.

The finishing is good especially in space grey colour.

1714	Dinesh	Mar 19, 2015	Yes	Simply Fantastic	Very satisfied with performance. Works with lightning speeds. Very easy to setup and add to my existing iOS device (iPad). Works fine independently and also with hand in hand with my iPad.  Camera is great  and top of it it's Slow Motion Video feature is absolutely unique. Initially  looking at the price tag I  was hesitant to buy this,  but now I have no doubts that it's a device worth the price. Pros . : Does not slow down even with more than 20 App. Running in the back ground. Cons. : Connection cable very short in length & Camera lens projects out of surface and is vulnerable to damage

1723	Tarun Jain	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	I Phone 6 product worth buying	Before using i phone 6 i always use to say that there is no point wasting money buuutttt after buying it few days back i am amused . If u can afford it than one should definatey go for it. Ultimate product.Before this I was using normal brand smart phone. I phone 6 is really great product with amazing feel in hands. Intially you need 10 12 days to get acquainted with it as lot of features are different from Android but this effort is worth it.
1724	kavisha gupta	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	buy again	good product
1725	Shankh!	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	My iPhone from Snapdeal	I did hesitate to purchases such a costly phone over the internet. But I had purchased an iPad mini before with Snapdeal, so had some confidence going forward. Snapdeal once again offered the best purchase price among all websites and phone was an original one too. Not a refurbished in my case at least.  The packaging was perfect and I received it within the first 3 days of ordering. The only drawback was that there was no option for an EMI with SBI cards, so I had to shell out another Rs 1000 with the card company to process the EMI.  Overall the phone is fab and super cool to use. I would have given you a perfect 5 if there was no hassle with the EMI. Keep up the good work.

1776	Sneh	Mar 09, 2015	Yes	Beautiful Phone & Sharp features	My first Iphone and I am thrilled to receive it within 2-3 days of ordering. The packing was good and the product suffered no damage during transit.    Powerful hardware complimented by a equally well designed operating system. iOS 8.1 is stunning. However, the product that I received has a slight yellowish tint  at the top of the screen. Searched it online and found that some apple products have this issue. Its been nagging me ever since because once you spend 50K+ on a device, you expect it to be flawless.
1777	Arpit	Mar 09, 2015	Yes	Awesome experience	Product received is perfect and delivered within time. Thanks.
1778	Bharath	Mar 05, 2015	Yes	16 GB is not enough, trust me	I have always dreamed of owning an iPhone ever since I saw the first generation iPhone. After waiting for so long my dream had finally come true. The phone was the cheapest on snapdeal than other competing retailers. So I right away booked it. I hope snapdeal changes its courier partner (gojavas) as they are not fast enough. The phone works great. Photos are fantastic and accurate. Love the slo-mo feature. I also love the TouchID. It works flawlessly 99% of the time. The call clarity is crystal clear. The speaker was surprisingly loud and clear. The oddly shaped bundled headset doesn't fit properly in my ear and is irritating sometimes. The battery life is good for playing music and doing calls. But it drains super fast when you're playing graphics intensive games. It lasts a day for me with moderate usage with 30mins voice calls, 3 hours whatsapp, an hour of gaming and 20 photos on average. I would definitely recommend you to get the 64GB version as I ran out of storage after installing a few apps, games and some music. I am planning on upgrading to the 64GB version as soon I save enough as I am becoming tired of actively managing the space on a 50k phone. The available space on phone out of 16GB out of the box was roughly around 12.8GB. I would also recommend you to get a lightning to micro-usb adapter as it would save quite a lot of troubles for you in charging your phone.
1779	parth	Mar 05, 2015	Yes	good	good service
1780	Ragzv	Mar 05, 2015	Yes	Product as promised slow delivery though	Product was well packaged and I received it without any damages to the phone box. But it took 5 working days for getting the product delivered to Kolkata. That is not acceptable or expected.
1781	The Hacker boy	Mar 05, 2015	Yes	Best Smartphone you will ever buy	The top smartphone brand in the world for now. Its nothing but Apple. This is the best smartphone experience I ever had. This is my first apple device ever, I own a note 4 and honestly I enjoyed apple iPhone 6 more in its software, it's simplicity and ultimate performance which beats up the note 4 badly. Pros:- 1) amazing battery life, on a fully charged battery, even after 10 hours of standby you will see 100% battery juice. 2)Amazing camera performance, this is an 8 megapixel camera but can beat the 13mp shooter on the note 3, and almost compete with the 16mp shooter on the note 4, evolving very clear colors in its pictures. 3)You just can't be disappointed with the front camera too. The front camera can beat the note 4's high resolution  camera easily. 4)Its Design is so seamless that it feels a solid curved slab in your hand. A premium built All metal Design. The front screen glass is 2.5D curved and is shatter proof glass with oleophobic coating that no other manufacturer provides. 5)Loudspeaker performance, you will be shocked to see that it's crystal clear sound at full level volume can beat the note 4's outstanding speaker itself!! And apple has done a very good job in placing the speaker on the side instead of ugly placement the note 4 has. 6)Touch ID is so quick and responsive. It is the best of the best fingerprint scanner on a device ever since 2013 from 5s. There is no other phone in the market yet to beat it's Touch ID.  Cons:- 1)this is a flagship smartphone of Apple but the display is not of high resolution, it's a 750p display. Its not a big con because on a 4.7 inch diagonal display you will still get crisper images and impossible to find pixels apart. You will get the difference only when you compare the screens side by side with a Quad HD display. 2)no more cons yet.  Overall I'm alot satisfied with this smartphone. My Daily driver is note 4, and for second use I'm happy with iphone 6  :)

But the real deal was the iPhone 6 which is still the latest technology i am using. I have seen no lags with the software and the timely updates offer great software experience. There is no doubt about the design of this mobile phone. Overall i would thank snanpdeal for a great ecomm experience.

1869	Anuj	Jan 29, 2015	Yes	Highly Appreciable both Reach and Price	Got the best price on snapdeal compared to other websites where the 64 gb was out of stock. Really appreciate that it is available at my location as it was not available on other websites. You guys are doing commendable job. Thanks.
1870	Alansa	Jan 29, 2015	Yes	Class apart	No matter what people say about Android taking over the market, having been an avid Iphone user since 2 years, I'd say this one is another phone that really stands out. From the design, to the touch quality and ofcourse the breathtaking camera clarity, it is definitely class apart!  Snapdeal took a bit long to deliver the same, however it was within the time frame as mentioned. The phone is functioning perfectly alright, and was a little cheaper than what is being offered in the offline stores.
1871	rishikesh kumar	Jan 29, 2015	Yes	One of nthe best phone I have ever seen	Only issue was with snapdeal .i ordered for gold colour and they dispatched grey. Moreover the mobile app was not showing any update status for transshipment. It was a poor service from snapdeal. The rating four star is for the phone. But for the snapdeal I will give one star for the service

Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is tad less than expected, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use.  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great phone and people should really buy it. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting this brand.
1876	beetelaces	Jan 29, 2015	Yes	Apple as always	The phone is fantastic. I don't think you need to say anything when it is apple. The screen size is just perfect (not too big as the iPhone 6 plus). The best is the motion sensor features though they are avail;able in iPhone 5s also, but here i get a larger screen as well.
1877	Arjun	Jan 29, 2015	Yes	PERFECT	Buying this phone through Snapdeal was a correct decision because they gave my money its full worth.

The only problen is with the battery backup, cud have been better. The best choice in this price range. Wud definitely recommend this to all my friends.
1882	Sam	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	iPhone 6 - fabulous and go for it	iPhone 6 is just super with perfect size, features, right speed and memory.  Any one if thinking GO or NO-GO, I would recommend as GO for it and doesn't get better than this.  Moreover, best possible offer on Snapdeal available compared to others.
1883	gaurav	Jan 22, 2015	Yes	Good price and quick service.	I had gone through lot of online websites but I always got a good price from the snapdeal.com.

1889	Ashish Nirankari	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	Fantastic apple product !!!	Wonderfull colour #genuine product, Good one # don't wait just go for it !!
1890	Raghuraj	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	WOW....!!	Wow... I ordered the phone o 14th and received the phone on 15th ... that too without any special delivery charges...kudos to snapdeal... Delivery aside, the phone was in awesome condition good packaging...Fully satisfied with the purchase
1891	Rishi	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	Go for it	The phone is overall good but a bit overrated. I got a very good bargain on Snapdeal but the delivery time is just too much. Otherwise everything's great.
1892	radcon27	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	loving it!!!	loving it!!! Superb!!
1893	thisisjinesh	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	If its perfect deal its snapdeal	I ordered iPhone 6 - 64 GB from Snapdeal. I got reasonable offer and delivery was just in time. Phone delivered in good and sealed condition. Overall it was a nice deal.
1894	Harkirat	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	Perfect & cheap one	Got iPhone6 64GB within time. Although doubtful about ecom courier, but nothing to complain. And got the least price comparing other popular sites. +++ for seller & snapdeal
1895	Gurpreet	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	Aweome services	I love to shop from snapdeal I got 2 iphone 6 in a month and it got delivered on time.  Keep it up guys
1896	ABHISEK PARIJA	Jan 16, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	I have been a long time iphone user. Have used 5, 5s & now 6.  Theres nothing new to iOS devices but the iphone 6 takes the iOS experience to a whole new level with the bigger screen. Its extremely thin and a pleasure to hold. The screen is literally scratch resistent, but the back is quite delicate. Camera is top notch as with all iPhones. This is a completely lag free device. And i got it for a very good price at snapdeal (made the courier boy open the pack in front of me before taking delivery, many horror stories doing the rounds). Batery is surprisingly good in this device and can easily see you through a day with moderate use and charges very very fast.  Overall a great device to have which will last 2 years minimum and then sell with a good resale value.  Go ahead and purchase it , you will enjoy the experience.
1897	prathamesh	Jan 16, 2015	No	Perfect!!!	I recommend this product!!!

1905	sunny	Jan 11, 2015	Yes	Best Iphone so far......but expensive	this is the best iphone launched so far and feels great. Size is now finally perfect and camera is fantastic.  Battery life is an area where major improvement is needed.   however i will give it only 4 stars due to the price....it is easy to get top of the line specs in android phones at very reasonable prices now unlike in the case of apple.   if you just love iOS beyond anything else in a mobile phone, go for for this phone blindly, else can consider android

1910	Vineet Chhajer	Jan 06, 2015	No	Super Phone at a Very Special Price!	I Bought the Iphone6 64 GB (Space Grey) on Snapdeal and was very satisfied. The Price was very good and the Phone is Superb, Very few lags and a Good battery life despite just 1800 mh battery.  The Camera is excellent and the Touch is great. The Enlarged screen size means better pixels and better gaming.  All in all very happy with my 1st Apple Phone.

1918	Suresh Thunga	Dec 30, 2014	Yes	Fortune favours the brave	Off all the pesimistic comments of rocks, soap and empty boxes, goods without warranty that i read about on the reviews and blogs, i still went ahead and bought the iphone 6 online ( Frankly the best price i found)  ETD was 30th Dec, but came in on 28th Dec, delivered like a professional.  Awaited patiently while we opened it to check for rocks, soap or empty boxes and all other surprises we were "warned" about.    No surprises that the phone was there.  no doubt will order online again.  these guys are only sellers, they don't manufacture it, so why should i not order from the cheapest supplier there is???
1919	Ravi	Dec 30, 2014	Yes	Best Phone	This phone is the best phone.Good Snapdeal service.
1920	Sam	Dec 30, 2014	No	Apple ROCKS Again !!!!!!!	Five days back I purchased this from from a Retailor in Bangalore and belive me it is a awesome phone with awesome technology and many so ons......No Price Difference I believe throughout India price is the same for I phone 6 Plus thats how Apple is..  Pros Awesome UI, Amazing Body, Camera is excellent during Day n Night, Front camera clarity is also very good. Batterylife - Amazing..When its Apple forget about phone getting hang.  All I can say it was very good move from Android to IOS.  Cons---No way nothing...and don't think of also  Please go ahead and buy this phone guys its awesome...
1921	sam	Dec 30, 2014	Yes	awsome phone	go for it
1922	KV	Dec 30, 2014	Yes	Great Phone: Stylish, Super Responsive	I phone 6 is a great phone becasue 1. Cool & Stylish design 2. Very thing & elegant 3. Super responsive, never saw a phone so great in response. Does not hang! Here you go Android :-) 4. Very good camera especially in low light 5. Bad part is consumes quite a bit of battery. It can be improved since phone is always on 3G (it comes to 2g though where 3G is not available). But this will change when Airtel will come with Carrier settings. Thats why 1 Star less. Otherwise no other complaint

1928	Lalit Goyal	Nov 13, 2014	Yes	Nice Phone	I have switched from android to iOS it feels nice but lacks a few small but very useful features like vibrate on call connect, can see the contact when we dial few digits of the phone number, etc. battery life is amazing sometimes it runs for 2 full days.

Nov 13, 2014	Yes	Awesome mobile....	one of the best mobile available in the market, keep the sentence in mind, one of the best, not the best, a lot of more features in a lot of other phone, but the brand appeal makes it the best, the proud of owning an apple is always thr....so will definitely recommend it....
1932	kiran	Nov 13, 2014	Yes	The best smartphone of 2014	It doesn't get any better. The specs, the performance, the device and the display are just stunning. You have to use this to believe it. 64 GB of space makes me so happy and not worry about photos and videos anymore.
