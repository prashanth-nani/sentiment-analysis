Its Touch is Brilliant... The camera quality is Nice in Light bt it is not suitable for Low Light Photography otherwise the camera is good... The processor is Very Fast and it is the true Octa-Core... The Ram is 1GB which is suitable. Although it starts lagging when free ram is about 100-150mb bcause of heavy Octa-Core processor... Its battery backup is also fine and its Screen Quality is Simply Brilliant... In a Nut-Shell along with the brand name of hTC this is a very good phone and i will prefer this phone in its Price Range...

VIDEO PLAYBACK IS OFF THE HOOK AND SOOO SMOOTH (THE GTX EXP.) - HTC clear motion does the trick!  CONS: --very annoying Internal mem. only 4gb -- pissing off Ram only 1GB --UNCOOL Though it's an octa-core processor because of low ram and internal mem. when the ram gets to 850mb/900mb phone lags a little bit.  Camera quality is bad.....cheap quality camera...low light photography is so primitive! Other than that i am happy and an esteemed owner of a HTC Product!!
