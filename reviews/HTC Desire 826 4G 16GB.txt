15	anuj	Dec 21, 2015	Yes	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this mas	nice phone..very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

85	BS	Aug 08, 2015	Yes	Awesome...Great Features....a true value for money	I purchased this phone a month back after doing a lot of ref. check/reviews on the internet. Despite mixed reviews about the phone, I went for it. And I must say that the features exceed our expectations from a phone in this range. Battery backup is great...some had complained that the battery heats up but I have never found any such problem with my phone. Both the cameras (rear and front) are excellent giving truly high-resolution pictures. So whether you are taking selfies or taking a snap of the location, the picture quality is awesome. The interface is user-friendly. Speakers and voice quality is excellent and soothing to the ears. I would say that the overall the experience is far better than Samsung, which I had been using all these years.
