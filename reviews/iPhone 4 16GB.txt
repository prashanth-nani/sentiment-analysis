Thankyou snapdeal
4	Sumit Jindal	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	Gr8 Phone & Gr8Customer service as usual	Awesome Still Better than many android phones. I'am having one newly lunched android phone but it lags sometimes but iPhone 4 is awesome. The apple's A4 chip works very fast ios is very easy to use. It will be better for both Personal and business use. Awesome phone. Thumbs Up....
5	Nitin	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	Trustworthy Workhorse..	Based on having owned this phone as long as I have, here's my take on the Pros & Cons, vs Android phones that may cost as much:  Pros: - Access to the latest iOS experience, without having to pay a bomb for it - Perfectly usable screen (retina display; can't go wrong with it) - Most apps, including graphic intensive games, continue to be usable - Battery life is decent; (can last for a day and a half with moderate usage) - Call voice quality is great; - Vs Android Phones: Ease of Use(Idiot Proof); better app quality (UI, responsiveness) - Very Durable; dropped it 50+ times- nothing!  Cons: - Camera quality can no longer be called 'great'(5MP); Great for instagram, not much else. Same goes for video - End of the road from an upgradation perspective (Don't see this getting iOS 7+) - Phone speakers are not especially loud; I frequently miss calls - No LTE; A concern if you're in a city that's seeing 4G/LTE connectivity (Pune, Bangalore, Kolkata)

25	Ashutosh	Mar 22, 2014	Yes	iPhone review	Its Apple after all. The brand speaks. Its a very good product.
26	SILAMBARASAN	Mar 22, 2014	Yes	AWESOME	The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone line, incorporating an uninsulated stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna, with internal components situated between chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass. With these changes, Apple claimed that the iPhone 4 was the thinnest smartphone in the world.The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's new Retina Display technology; while maintaining the same physical size and display resolution as its precursors, its liquid crystal display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs claimed was higher than what a human's retina could distinguish at an average distance. The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple's new FaceTime video chat service.
