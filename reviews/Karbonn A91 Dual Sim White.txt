5	sudhee	Apr 06, 2015	Yes	Worth for paid money	Pro's: Resulation is good. Camera is good outside in sunlight. Touch sensitivity is Good. Very good built quality  cons:  Low ram, mobile will be very slow if you load many things. No flash. Front is camera is almost useless in normal light. Very low internal memory, almost full with inbuilt apps
