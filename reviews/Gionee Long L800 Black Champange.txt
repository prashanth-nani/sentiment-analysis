10	mahatogautam01	Mar 20, 2016	Yes	GEO... nee L800	Ordered on 22nd December and got as a gift of Jesus on 25th.  Under 2500rs it's absolutely a value for the money product!!! At first I was considering to go for nokia then changed my mind to go for samsung but then at last after going through lots of POSITIVE reviews from different sites I finally ended up on this and after 5 days of using (Now My Baba's Phone) I am fully happy and satisfied with my decision. Everything is perfect in this phone except the two things which I didn't like..i.e.  #1 While scrolling up & down we have to press the buttons each n every time and #2 If in place of facebook and messenger there would have been only what'sapp then this phone might have got the privilege of going on side by side to any smart phone... Though it's possible even now also simply because of its TREMENDOUS battery power.  Thanks SD for this wonderful Dil Ka Deal!!!

17	Dark Knight	Dec 27, 2015	Yes	Gionee Long L800 - Awesome Phone in its category	This Phone is awesome. Remember that its not an Android based phone. Its a basic phone. But what makes this phone outstanding is its BATTERY - 3000mAh. I bought this phone for my mother. She uses this phone only for calls and music and the battery streches to 30 days easily without any hassle. This is not a joke...seriously 30 DAYS. Every other feature is as mentioned on this Snapdeal page. Camera is not good though. It comes with a 1 year Brand Warranty. If you are looking for a basic phone for calls or msgs with a very good battery, then this is it. Also, its worth gifting to elder people who are not so good with touchscreen phones. Definitely worth buying. Go for it.
18	Aks	Dec 27, 2015	Yes	Enjoy the price	Good product ..and delivered in good   condition
19	LAXREN	Dec 27, 2015	Yes	****	Very good battery backup. But it has only 282.5Kb internal storage capacity. Also has a pre-installed Opera Mini browser, but it does not work. Overall it is a good phone in this price segment.

25	Giridhar	Nov 02, 2015	Yes	best phone	i have bought this phone 2 nd time after a search for  long search of 1 month for a phone as secondary for me and  for my mom , its undoubtbly best phone among all below 3.5k feature phones like samsung 360, 3322 or nokia series phones in following aspects pros: 1. charge once forget it has a stand by for more than a month  2. whooping 3000mah batery lasts for 20 days for normal users and daily users can expect 10-14 days based on their usage  3: excellent call clarity and noise reduction .  4: loud speakers not loud as china made but worth  5:new user interface good for youth, elders may find difficult in beginning but later love it  6: strong built, mine last even after several falls just like nokia 1100 finally earphones and charger are of excellent  quality   cons:  no internal memory, memory card is must     just go for it without any doubt, surely you will love it either way and   you will like me for my review

The center key is hard/hurts while pressing it for moving up/down/sides. Holding a Up or down key doesn't scroll over the list instead it stays like that, so you had to press it as many times as needed.  Pros: 1. Battery 2. Response time / Performance 3. Clear Audio without disturbance for songs. 4. Call clarity is clear, loud and audible. 5. User Interface is very friendly and easily accessible.  Cons: 1. Video of size exceeding 5MB cannot be played.(Only audio no video.) 2. Camera don't even expect during night, in daylight you can take pictures manageable details just like nokia 1.3mp cameras.

102	joy	Dec 03, 2014	Yes	VERY GOOD PRODUCT	I& MY FRIEND PURCHED 5 HAND SET THIS MODEL VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
103	Advice Expert	Dec 03, 2014	Yes	Worth every rupee paid for it!!!	Pros 1.Very Long battery life. 2.Very good display resolution. 3.Sound is loud & clarity is good. 4.Screen is big enough to watch videos perfectly. 5.Fast & smmoth browsing through opera mini browser. 6.Decent camera in daylight. 7.Stylish design that makes you feel proud though it is just a bar phone, elegant in looks. 8.Call quality is good - loud & clear. 9.Can install whatsapp by taking the bill to the service centre which will automatically deactivate the FB & Twitter apps in mobile (I still haven't installed it yet but when I called them, they asked me to come today to install whatsapp, yeah its WHATSAPP!!!)  Cons 1.Transferring of contacts is difficult as it doesn't support the common .vcf format for transferrinf of contacts in bulk but supports .vcf for individual contacts, so need to use the sim card for transferring of contacts. 2.Inbuilt FB app is dead slow. 3.Opera Mini that is installed is an old vrsion. It is fast but doesn't support multi tabs, just a single tab browsing. 4.The phone hangs every time when I use "My Style" profile and try to set ringtones for the 2 different sim cards. (Not sure whether anybody else has reported this problem) 5.Very low internal memory (2MB approx) that will not allow you to install any java app by yourself though the phone supports java. 6.Messaging doesn't have T9. So for those who are addicted to text using T9 have to think twice!  Verdict For the price that you pay for it, it is worth every single rupee.
104	malaichamy.B	Dec 03, 2014	Yes	perfect phone	this battery back up is very much appreciated than other phone ie 3000mah battery withstand somany days. one default i find internet speed is very slow and camera is poor quality, price also slightly high when compared this feature
105	TARUN PADHY	Dec 03, 2014	Yes	very good phone within budget	Got a very very good phone within a budget. All basic things can be done through this phone with best battery life. This brand has overtaken other brands like SAMSUNG and other similar types of phones. Although delivery period from the date of purchase to door step was very high(about 10 days) as compared to other,same recommended to improve by snap deal. This is my third android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp. VERY GOOD BATTERY BACKUP!!!! Cons: speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
