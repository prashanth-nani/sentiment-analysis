7	Arun	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Infocus Bingo 21	Hi, I bought this product through snapdeal on 16th  March 2016. I ordered it on 12th and I got the expected delivery date as 18 Mar. But Snapdeal delivered to me 2 days before. Thanks for that.  The mobile is fantastic. I bought the orange panel. Its look is very good. Its camera quality is too good. Touch screen sensitivity also good. Battery backup upto 1 day only as per other android phones.  It is unexpectable thing in this price with 2GB RAM, 8MP and 5MP camera with front flash, 2300 mAh battery, 8GB ROM, 4.5'' screen,  front flash, etc.   Thanx for the product.

52	Jai	Mar 14, 2016	Yes	Overall a Good budget phone	Do not expect "Awesomeness" out of this phone, but its a nice, decent low-budget android smartphone. You can perform all the regular tasks such as calling messaging, clicking pictures, listening to music, social networking (with 4G) and also playing some light-weight games.  Te only problem is, you can't find any compatible accessories, even on SnapDeal, even after couple of months of launching.

54	Sumit	Mar 14, 2016	Yes	Good low cost phone	Basic features of the phone are quite good. Being an ordinary user, this phone must temp you, however, camera (rear) isn,t that sharp and also the color looks a bit over done. Call quality is good. looks cheap ( what else do you want in this price!). rest is ok. Can think of it as an option. At least better than the rest i guess.
55	Ashwani	Mar 14, 2016	Yes	refer everyone who needs a good budget phone	Phone is good ,but front flash is not that good.camera is clarity is good front and back. Just pre installed app is the most annoying thing i felt Overall good fone in this price segment

And without using internet phone gives backup for about 2 days.Overall good for the price.

89	Achuth Shenoy	Mar 06, 2016	Yes	Affordable Android.	It is perfect.  Camera - Both front and back working fine. In low light flash is a must.  Performance- 1.5 GHz processor with 2GB RAM helps you to play good graphic games without heating. No lag in normal usage too.  Display -Good colour reproduction. For this price range it is perfect.  Speaker- Good not bad.  Battery- Gives you almost a day of usage.  Touch- Solid response.  On the whole you can go for it without any doubt.  More apps in the background made the phone warm on the back. But it is like any other smartphone.

The most crucial thing is the warranty card. I had a call with  Snapdeal they told me to that they will arrange those two things and send me and had also told me me place replacement mentioning the problem. Lets see what happens.  But I will recommend to go with this phone  as the phone is superb

165	Kasi	Feb 19, 2016	Yes	poor receiver speaker volume.	I've got the phone from Snap deal. Everything is fine except the receiver speaker volume. Unable to hear anything. If your speaker is on we can answer to the phone. Or else you wont hear anything. I thought this is defect piece and ordered another one. That's also have the same problem. So I don't know what to do now.

170	suhaspadmane	Feb 19, 2016	Yes	Compramising	Battery charging takes lot of time (7-8 hours for full charging) and mobile becomes hot. Resolution is poor. Screen width is less. Camera qulaity so so. Quite heavy compared to size.
171	Rakesh	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Do Not Buy Even By Mistake	I purchased the phone on 13th  1) battery drains like hell cheap phones like lava xolo intex give better back up then this 2) screen resolution is very poor feels using 2012 model screen 3) network is not stable on & off 4) No return guarantee from snapdeal now they are saying to get me certified regarding issues then only theyll return  5)if its ur hard earned money then go for branded phones

173	pansarishubham1	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Performancewise too good	Performance of the phone is good But the front flash is of no  use  Front camera is good
174	Amit Jha	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Just OK as compared to M2	My first Infocus phone was M2 3G. I was oversatisfied if compared with Bingo. Usable Ram is less. Rear Camera quality not matchable with M2. Front camera offcourse cant match as 2 mp only.   Bought Bingo only B'coz M2 is not available. Wish they could launch it again. Service bad in Nagpur. company struggling to have a proper service centre here.

176	Sachin	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Best phone in this range	I have used this phone . It is best phone in this range. Only one lags that backside camera performance in night is very bad. Front camera is awasome. Purely design for selfi. Most of the latest feature you can see in this. Value for money

178	Avishek	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Usage Review	Just got my hands on the Bingo..here is my impression 1. Cool UI, simple & fast. 2. Touch is responsive 3. Back camera is average..Front camera is good for selfie 4. Battery backup is superb. 5. Headphone sound quality is good. 6.Screen clarity is good. 7.No hardware menu(Back/Home/Menu) button, its an irony still the space is not saved since the INFOCUS logo is there. 8. Speaker quality is pathetic; cant hear sound of music with native music player. 9.   OVerall its a good but the Phicomm Energy 2 is a better deal...One of my friend has purchased it

180	Brahmareddy uppalapadu podili	Feb 17, 2016	Yes	Awesome pnone but some  prblms there	camera not well not like 8mp&5mp   quality  photoes.compare other 8mp&5mp camera not awesome,im not satisfy
181	Ak	Feb 15, 2016	Yes	Worth every penny	At the outset, snapdeal packing and delivery is appreciable   On phone,  Touch response is imppecable  Display is pleasant on eyes  In buit call recorder does a perfect call tapping job Camera shooters produce excellent shots  On call voice clarity is fantastic  No lags found yet  For this budget price, disappointing factors are prudent  They are; Poor quality ear phones  Not so loud speaker  Plastic back panel  Faster battery drain    All in all, phone is the best in this range with excellent performance of essentials!!!
