92	ImranKhan	Feb 25, 2015	Yes	Good phone at a reasonable price.	Bought this phone to my mom and she likes it. The last HTC phone I'd used was wildfire and htc was expensive then in 2009. Desire 516 is good phone to normal usage. Loved the charger provided as it charges the battery to full in about an hour. I'm using the same charger for my note 2. The phone does not freeze for normal usage. Did not notice any heating issues.and the battery back up is decent too.HTC phones are good looking, unlike Samsung which look plasticy and cheap. The build quality of desire 516 is very nice and sturdy. I liked the phone although haven't put it to test with heavy apps. video calls what's app and similar applications work normally. Camera quality is decent. This phone is worth the money.  I got a free flip cover which normally costs about 500-800 rupees. In short I'm satisfied with the Purchase and would recommend it at the current price.
93	Bhagavan	Feb 25, 2015	Yes	not satisfied	if u r a HTC lover, then only u buy this phone. Otherwise it waste of money. poor camera quality.  product delivered 5 days after the order placed.So not a bad delivery.

104	Mukesh Mishra	Jan 29, 2015	No	Planning For New Cell phone	Hey Every one! I would like to inform you about HTC Desire 516 4Gb  i am planning to change my old phone  The HTC Desire 516 sports a 5-inch LCD 540 x 960 pixels multi-touch display with 220 ppi pixels density. Encased in a classic full black colored body, it weighs around 173g and has a 9.7mm thick body. The HTC Desire 516 operates on Android v4.2 Jelly Bean platform with HTC's Sense UI on top.  Processor and RAM  The HTC smartphone is equipped with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor which is clocked at a speed of 1.2GHz. The onboard memory (RAM) is 1GB which further aids to the processor speed and performance.   Camera and Storage  The handset is packed with dual cameras; 5MP rear camera and 2MP front facing camera. Like every other HTC phone, even this phone quirks with camera quality. Even though the resolutions are less, they offer good quality videos and photos. The device comes with ample storage memory which is further expandable via microSD slot.   Connectivity and others  For staying connected with other devices, the HTC phone features Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB port, 3G etc. It is fuelled by a 1,950mAh battery, which claims to offer 9 hours of talktime and 220 hours of standby time on 3G networks.  Verdict This 5-incher falls under the mid-range phablet category yet packed with impressive features like a powerful processor and decent cameras. The device lacks an HD display but still renders great visuals. Great option if you are looking for a budget phablet with a good brand value.
