89	Avinash	Oct 08, 2015	Yes	Hii	Good product at reasonable price. I am happy with the phone.
90	sarath	Oct 08, 2015	Yes	Premium product for cheap rate	I bought the htc desire 620g last week from snapdeal after a bitter experience from flipkart for the same product 2weeks before. Snapdeal delivery was quick and pleasing. I have been using this product since then and it has been a pleasant trip uptill now and i hope it goes on like this. Good phone, good battery backup, quick reaponse ui, no heating probs aftr long usage,pretty average display for this rate, average sound quality. The best part is the premium finish look of the santorini white model, looks like a high end fone for the viewers. One small concern would be the intrnal storage, just around 4.3gb of 8gb usable and aftr installing regularly used apps it has already reduced to 3.2gb and guess will have to be choosy on the apps in the future..all in all a good product for the price range

120	anish	Sep 26, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone	Awesome Phone in this price range, very good product, my rating 5/5...
121	Shiv	Sep 18, 2015	Yes	Go for it. Especially for Students.	The phone is a great deal in this segment.  Pros : 1. Sharp super LCD display 2. Beautiful design and very slim, obviously fits your pocket. 3. Camera ! ah yeah , how did i forget that . It has a hot back camera of 8MP which completely suits for the resolution of the phone screen (5 inch approx) and with a pixel density of 294 ppi approx., the camera can be compared to any other smartphone's camera. The zoom density is simply superb and the inbuilt editing tools enhance the level of the camera's output to a very large extent. pictures are quietly brilliant !  The front camera is of 5MP pixel clarity, it also equals the performance of the back camera to some extent. focusing can be done automatically or manually. The picture clarity if both the front and back cameras are at their best class ! A big thumbs up for this . 4. Next comes the processor, Memory and RAM. Many people confuse by reading the inbuilt memory as 8GB and they get infuriated after they find that only 4.3GB is available as an internal storage. The thing is, New android phones are having their internal memories being split internally again, into two partitions. out of 8GB, the 4.3GB memory space is the one which acts as an internal SD card and no system files are present in this 4.3GB slot ! (please read that twice and understand) , the remaining memory out of 8GB is taken as the system partition where no user files can be stored. 4.3GB-5.5GB IS THE SAME WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN ALL ANDROID SYSTEMS THAT HAVE 8GB INTERNAL where the rest is taken as system files storage. This is done after the phone is booted, usually. But in this phone it is factory made. SO IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.   Read only Memory (RAM) is not a concern where the processor is of Octa core type. this phone runs on a mediatek MT6*** variant , which has a clock speed of 1.7GHz inbuilt and it can also be overclocked to 2GHz full triggering. If you take a look at other smartphones, the processor will either be of quad core or of dual core but OCTA CORE is rare and trust me, THIS PHONE IS FREAKIN' FAST ! AND NO BOILING AT THE BACK :D Again a BIG thumbs up for the performance of this phone. Please Note : Mediatek is not anyway behind snapdragon . The camera clarity, performance, UI softness and Gaming depends on this Mediatek beast that supports this phone and its the best part in this variant .   5. Next is the battery, which is of 2100 mAh capacity and the phone stands for day (Trust me!) when the WiFi is turned on throughout. Isn't that amazing ? Now i guess that is enough . 6. Looking at the UI now. User interface is, as the name suggests, completely user friendly. it has a quick ,less glitching user interface which shows that anyone can use this phone at a high degree of ease.  7. Another Pro is the graphics. Heavy duty games like Dead trigger etc run smoothly without heating up and without any lag. The Mali 4** graphics chipset variant is surely a big pro in this device.  8. All other google features, browsers, inbuilt apps, HTC exclusive features make this phone a very good first class mid rager and as well as a high ranger ( you can compare this device with any high range phone)  Cons :  1. First thing would be the glossy look. im sure that many people wouldn't actually prrefer so much gloss at the back. but u can always get rid of it by using a case at the back and i guess the GLOSSY LOOK wouldn't bother the buyers of this phone as far as the true specs performance ratio and other features are concerned.   2. The third party apps present in the phone cannot be hosted directly from the ext3, that is the external SD card as only the apps data is stored in the memory card. This can also be passed by getting a root access, and i wouldn't recommend regular users to get root permissions. This memory concern is NOT A BIG DEAL here in this phone .  3. The specs list of this phone DOESN'T specify that the audio has a feature of boom sound. But the sound clarity is pretty decent.  4. Now i wouldn't recommend Music lovers and sound engineers to use the headset that comes inbox with this phone as it is not that good. Since this phone has a universal 3.5mm jack, any good brand headphones can be replaced instead of the inbox pair, and ofcourse ! the clarity of sound is awesome if you use any THIRD PARTY headphone.   Overall, This phone is a Great at this price range. About Snapdeal:The packaging was great and I received it on the 4th day.
122	shahid	Sep 18, 2015	Yes	Reliable service of snapdeal	The product and services are very good of snapdeal but this only depends on the amount that how much price of the product.

150	Dev gurjar	Sep 03, 2015	Yes	Nice	Nice product and very good price camera quality is  Good battery back up so good
151	abc	Aug 28, 2015	Yes	nice	Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
152	upkar	Aug 28, 2015	Yes	perfect phone	awesome phone in this price! htc dot view ,blinkfeeds gr8 feature
153	PRADEEP VERMA	Aug 28, 2015	Yes	GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST	I bought it solely because i thought it will get lollipop update now that i know, it doesn’t. There’s really not much difference left between this phone and samsung phone. You can also compare it with Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime as it comes with a front 5 MP camera. But then again, it’s not really a selfie camera. Doesn’t mean it’s a bad camera. Its just it does not have the same features as a selfie camera. Anyway for the extra price you are going to get HTC’s name and quality if nothing else.The 5-inch Super LCD screen has a 720p HD resolution with a 294ppi pixel density.Fits well in the hand with the 5-inch 720p display easy to reach on all sides.The handset runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat,but there's no word on an update to Android 5.0 Lollipop. It does not have boom sound speakers. It is HTC’s clever placement of the speaker and ear piece which makes it look like it has boom sound speaker. It has only one speaker at the bottom. And the quality of that speaker is quite good. It’s pretty loud. The only issue i had with it, is its clarity. It creates a distorting noise sometimes while playing music at high volume.   CAMERA: Takes very good photos in good lighting conditions. But in bad light or low light the quality degrades a lot and it picks up a lot of noise and doesn’t pick up that much details  CONNECTIVITY:The only thing I am going to miss out is 4G. Apart from that it has all the rest of the connectivity option like dual SIM, 3G, Wifi, Bluetooth 4.0. WiFi of this phone is quite fast and doesn’t lose connectivity even if you leave it to download apps during all night. Only for htc lovers.

192	Sam	Jun 25, 2015	Yes	Received what I expected	perfect phone for daily use .
193	keyur patel	Jun 25, 2015	Yes	Awesome product	I've been using this phone for the past one week and trust me, this is one of the best, High-range android HTC variants. I'm an android junior developer and i've been testing the performance of this phone at every possible rate. Please review after using this product and not by seeing the specs. This Phone has the following Pros and Cons : Pros : 1. Sharp super LCD display 2. Beautiful design and very slim, obviously fits your pocket. 3. Camera ! ah yeah , how did i forget that . It has a hot back camera of 8MP which completely suits for the resolution of the phone screen (5 inch approx) and with a pixel density of 294 ppi approx., the camera can be compared to any other smartphone's camera. The zoom density is simply superb and the inbuilt editing tools enhance the level of the camera's output to a very large extent. pictures are quietly brilliant !  The front camera is of 5MP pixel clarity, it also equals the performance of the back camera to some extent. focusing can be done automatically or manually. The picture clarity if both the front and back cameras are at their best class ! A big thumbs up for this . 4. Next comes the processor, Memory and RAM. Many people confuse by reading the inbuilt memory as 8GB and they get infuriated after they find that only 4.3GB is available as an internal storage. The thing is, New android phones are having their internal memories being split internally again, into two partitions. out of 8GB, the 4.3GB memory space is the one which acts as an internal SD card and no system files are present in this 4.3GB slot ! (please read that twice and understand) , the remaining memory out of 8GB is taken as the system partition where no user files can be stored. 4.3GB-5.5GB IS THE SAME WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN ALL ANDROID SYSTEMS THAT HAVE 8GB INTERNAL where the rest is taken as system files storage. This is done after the phone is booted, usually. But in this phone it is factory made. SO IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.   Read only Memory (RAM) is not a concern where the processor is of Octa core type. this phone runs on a mediatek MT6*** variant , which has a clock speed of 1.7GHz inbuilt and it can also be overclocked to 2GHz full triggering. If you take a look at other smartphones, the processor will either be of quad core or of dual core but OCTA CORE is rare and trust me, THIS PHONE IS FREAKIN' FAST ! AND NO BOILING AT THE BACK :D Again a BIG thumbs up for the performance of this phone. Please Note : Mediatek is not anyway behind snapdragon . The camera clarity, performance, UI softness and Gaming depends on this Mediatek beast that supports this phone and its the best part in this variant .   5. Next is the battery, which is of 2100 mAh capacity and the phone stands for day (Trust me!) when the WiFi is turned on throughout. Isn't that amazing ? Now i guess that is enough . 6. Looking at the UI now. User interface is, as the name suggests, completely user friendly. it has a quick ,less glitching user interface which shows that anyone can use this phone at a high degree of ease.  7. Another Pro is the graphics. Heavy duty games like Dead trigger etc run smoothly without heating up and without any lag. The Mali 4** graphics chipset variant is surely a big pro in this device.  8. All other google features, browsers, inbuilt apps, HTC exclusive features make this phone a very good first class mid rager and as well as a high ranger ( you can compare this device with any high range phone)  Cons :  1. First thing would be the glossy look. im sure that many people wouldn't actually prrefer so much gloss at the back. but u can always get rid of it by using a case at the back and i guess the GLOSSY LOOK wouldn't bother the buyers of this phone as far as the true specs performance ratio and other features are concerned.   2. The third party apps present in the phone cannot be hosted directly from the ext3, that is the external SD card as only the apps data is stored in the memory card. This can also be passed by getting a root access, and i wouldn't recommend regular users to get root permissions. This memory concern is NOT A BIG DEAL here in this phone .  3. The specs list of this phone DOESN'T specify that the audio has a feature of boom sound. But the sound clarity is pretty decent.  4. Now i wouldn't recommend Music lovers and sound engineers to use the headset that comes inbox with this phone as it is not that good. Since this phone has a universal 3.5mm jack, any good brand headphones can be replaced instead of the inbox pair, and ofcourse ! the clarity of sound is awesome if you use any THIRD PARTY headphone.   Overall, This phone is a Great at this price range. It is NOT unworthy of the money u pay, it is NOT anywhere behind other variants of this world :D . being a developer, I recommend this phone to everyone who is searching for a good HTC phone at this price. A BIG THUMBS UP.

If you take a look at other smartphones, the processor will either be of quad core or of dual core but OCTA CORE is rare and trust me, THIS PHONE IS FREAKIN' FAST ! AND NO BOILING AT THE BACK :D Again a BIG thumbs up for the performance of this phone. Please Note : Mediatek is not anyway behind snapdragon . The camera clarity, performance, UI softness and Gaming depends on this Mediatek beast that supports this phone and its the best part in this variant .   5. Next is the battery, which is of 2100 mAh capacity and the phone stands for day (Trust me!) when the WiFi is turned on throughout. Isn't that amazing ? Now i guess that is enough . 6. Looking at the UI now. User interface is, as the name suggests, completely user friendly. it has a quick ,less glitching user interface which shows that anyone can use this phone at a high degree of ease.  7. Another Pro is the graphics. Heavy duty games like Dead trigger etc run smoothly without heating up and without any lag. The Mali 4** graphics chipset variant is surely a big pro in this device.  8. All other google features, browsers, inbuilt apps, HTC exclusive features make this phone a very good first class mid rager and as well as a high ranger ( you can compare this device with any high range phone)  Cons :  1. First thing would be the glossy look. im sure that many people wouldn't actually prrefer so much gloss at the back. but u can always get rid of it by using a case at the back and i guess the GLOSSY LOOK wouldn't bother the buyers of this phone as far as the true specs performance ratio and other features are concerned.   2. The third party apps present in the phone cannot be hosted directly from the ext3, that is the external SD card as only the apps data is stored in the memory card. This can also be passed by getting a root access, and i wouldn't recommend regular users to get root permissions. This memory concern is NOT A BIG DEAL here in this phone .  3. The specs list of this phone DOESN'T specify that the audio has a feature of boom sound. But the sound clarity is pretty decent.  4. Now i wouldn't recommend Music lovers and sound engineers to use the headset that comes inbox with this phone as it is not that good. Since this phone has a universal 3.5mm jack, any good brand headphones can be replaced instead of the inbox pair, and ofcourse ! the clarity of sound is awesome if you use any THIRD PARTY headphone.   Overall, This phone is a Great at this price range. It is NOT unworthy of the money u pay, it is NOT anywhere behind other variants of this world :D . being a developer, I recommend this phone to everyone who is searching for a good HTC phone at this price. A BIG THUMBS UP (y).

328	Sourajit Jash	May 01, 2015	Yes	Not bad in the price range!	I was looking for one phone in this range with some features and also one from a brand that has mostly positive feedbacks in the world of smartphone. It's true many will go for Yureka or Mi3 to have more features. But I am doubtful about service of Xiaomi and never found interest in Micromax! Hence I decided to buy Htc phone with octa core to exploit more parallelism. Then after surfing e-cmmerce sites for several fortnights, have been able to place order at nominal amount. "If you want to earn something, you have to spend either time or money ;)" Now it is time to explore this phone. Wish it had 2 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM!!
329	sandy	May 01, 2015	Yes	am happy with this !!.	I recieved my htc 620g smartphone its working good and am happy with the servicr as well as with the product quality hope so in future i'll not face any problem :)

If you are on minimal budget then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brand
346	vivek	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	good phone	Pros-Octa core gives good speed. Dual speakers gives good sound cons-Battery is only 2100 mah n ram is 1gb in which 400 mb is always used by system without any application is running..

368	Colonel	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	It satisfied all my requirements !	The product is a value-for-money item. Nothing more or short than what was shown on the site. It gives you the "feel good" factor. It does misbehave at times, but that is commonplce with any hi tech gadget. I am delighted and plan to go for another product of the same company in the future.
369	karthic	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	HTC 620 G	Awesome

376	Harshwardhan	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Good one	I ordered HTC Desire 620 G and the amzer back cover. Mostly the delivery was prompt and the product was as expected. I would have expected that the phone and cover should reach on the same day but the cover reached later. Otherwise it was overall a good experience.
377	darun	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	best phone for this price range	really good phone, The jump up to a 5-inch screen isn't something you really notice and, while spreading 720p HD across a bigger screen doesn't always pay off, it's a big improvement on the 610.
378	Mohit Bhardwaj	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this Price Range	This phone is very good and a well known brand makes it reliable.This phone got everything in it but there is one thing which i want to mention that the speaker loudness is not too high it is average but we can hear bass of music from the speaker. Snapdeal is very good in service and the courier service is also good and very fast.

380	Manoj	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	The best shopping experience of my life	I was on the lookout for a smartphone for my daughter,when I stumbled upon snapdeal's offer.I sat on it for a day unable to make a decision,eventually I did it,and mind you the experience quite baffled me,right from the time the order was placed to the delivery of the product.The product was excellent,packing superb,and most of all the price-real value for money,besides getting delivery two days ahead of the promised schedule of 6days,with timely reminders of the transit.Keep the good going Snapdeal-Looking forward to more of such experiences with you.
381	sree the tech savvy	Apr 20, 2015	Yes	Plan to recommend this phone to friends	Fantastic phone in its price range. Performance is beyond what I expected.

398	munna	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	nice one	The phone is looks good. Camera is superb, speed is good. But the sound is moderate. One really bad thing is you cannot move your apps to sd card. Its provides 4.4.2 instead of 4.4.4
399	Mr MRP	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	Awesome	awesome phone in this price
400	abhi	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	nice phone	best features at this price
401	Amit	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Sound quality is not Good!	HTC DESIRE 620G. Sound quality is too bad, n it's baas not work n low quality bass.... Otherwise product is Good but this is a big fault for me...!
402	saurabh	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	average phone	good phone but sounds is very slow. Only one speaker in the phone . Not led flash is very dim. Better to buy desire 816g
403	Ravi	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	good phone but	Nice phone in thid price range. But the main disadvantage is the battery, very poor backup, rest is good, nice touch, very fast, no lag gud camera, fast processor. And the phone provides poor sound output, these are the 2 cons of the phone.
404	Anurag	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Not for Music lovers!!!	This phone has mediatek chipset, which is cheap and worst. It cannot able to produce any bass...which is very disappointing. I tried poweramp but it also not work because of its hardware not able to produce clear and powerful music. and now on camera the rear camera comes with 8 MP resolution which takes good image in daylight only!!! In low light condition it camera sucks.. not commaprable with asus zenfone 5. but it has 1.7Ghz A7 octacore, which provide lag free interface. battery life also good on power saver which cutoff ocatacore to dualcore. So battery last long a day. Finally, i you want prformance go for it(means for gamming nd genral use), if you are music lover don't go for it you will totally  disappointed.
405	Tushar	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Such a best phone at 13-14 k	All features are best like camera (both) and also a nice processor which works smoothly but the one thing which i dnt like is its bettry back up which is too small for this phone only 2100mah. Rest is really good.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

419	VEER	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Product is awesome!	I have purchased this product product from snapdeal before 1 month and i must say this product satisfied me very much. The touch of this product is upto remark and if i talk about the performance of this mobile trust me performance of this product will surely satisfied you.This 1.7 Ghz processor really works i am writing this it's because there are too many mobiles brands which claims more Ghz but in reality it doesn't works. but this processor with this clock cycle really gives a smooth, good, and fast performance. Yet i never faced any lagging or hanging problems in this mobile. If we talk about the look then it also fulfill your expectation though i will suggest to go for white color it looks more attractive. if i talk about the game performance then also i am very much satisfied because i played some heavy games and the experience was very good it was very smooth to play heavy games in this mobile. Handling of this mobile is also very good and user friendly. I must say service of Snapdeal satisfied me, and also this is the only online shop which is selling this product in this range. Overall HTC rocks as well as snapdeal. Good job guys! Go for it no need to think more i am sure you will never regret by buying this product...Thank you!

552	Induj	Mar 26, 2015	Yes	Worth the cost	Initially I had no clue whether this would be a phone worth the risk but after i experienced, it turned out to be a great deal. The phone has great camera and doesnt hang. It looks slim and sleek and has a rich look. The drawback is that the vibration is not as strong as other my orevious phone moto e and it has a low volume. Both of these issue really dont matter to me.

End of the day charge will be down to 20%. You will not loose a single % of charge wen not in use ( in day time intervels or the whole night ). Overall good performance.

Pros:  1.Good display (10/10) 2.Camera quality both front and back (9/10) 3.Very good battery back up (10/10) 4.Stylish design. 5. Sound clarity. 6.HTC brand and HTC sense.

Camera is superb with flash light. It has very nice featurs too. But itz back is sooo glossy. And finger impression will b der. Video quality is also superb.

Earphone is not giving boom clearity in this phone but using in other phone it will get boom clearity.

809	saikat	Jan 30, 2015	Yes	Good	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
810	sujit	Jan 30, 2015	Yes	this product is perfect for user	Thank u for snapdeal to provide product on time. I would like to shopping with u good. HTC desire 620 g is very good mobile for use it's features are good. Again thank u for snapdeal team.

814	Rahul sharma	Jan 24, 2015	Yes	Brilliant Phone from HTC	I ordered this smartphone from snapdeal on 6 January.HTC Desire 620G is very fast and powerful phone With 5 MP front camera. It has 1.7 GHz octa core processor, Great camera , HD display but earphones sound is low. But I like this brilliant phone. Thank you snapdeal.
815	Pritom Das	Jan 24, 2015	Yes	Great buy for the price!	The back-cover is extremely hard to take off; but this does translate to a faux unibody design. Bar this, almost everything is excellent. Premium design and feel in hand. Hardly any lag. Useable camera, even indoors provided you can keep a steady hand.    For the cons, firstly the auto brightness sensor is terrible. AMOLED screens at this price do a somewhat better job. But at this price point, perhaps this is the first phone to truly challenge the Moto G 2nd Gen and beat it too!

818	vishal arora	Jan 24, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	ITS A ELEGANT GOOD LOOKING BUDGET PHONE. IT IS WORKING GOOD. BEST PHONE IN THIS BUDGET RANGE. I AM A REGULAR USER OF HTC AND THIS IS MY 5TH HTC PHONE AND I  REALLY FEEL THERE IS NOTHING LIKE HTC.
819	Aadi	Jan 24, 2015	Yes	Powerful Performance	1.7GHz octacore processor does makes your apps work like cream. Awesome phone with amazing specs from HTC. Would have been better if HTC would have provided more Internal Memory ( 4GB only for apps + storage) & HTC Boom which is lacking for all music lovers. Rest Phone is more than "ok to buy" :)
