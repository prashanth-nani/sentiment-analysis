5	Mounika	Mar 18, 2016	Yes	Mobile is so cuteeee....	Mble was good but I am very much disappointed in two things...one thing is about Sim slots, and the other thing is USB cable ...the wire is too short to keep charge ..every time I used to keep support for the mobile..my suggestion is please give other slot SD card along vth dual Sim slot. And provide USB cable vth good length...

13	kotikrishna.o	Jan 10, 2016	Yes	Quality and slim	Good quality in all aspects.
14	abdemirza0000	Jan 10, 2016	Yes	Good phone but not the best.	Super fast delivery by snapdeal.  I have a Coolpad Note 3 which I bought for Rs.9000 and then I ordered this phone only for its looks.  Pros : *Good Camera but its front camera which is 8 mp shoots exactly as my Coolpad which is 5 mp and I doesn't found any difference. *Its touch is very smooth *Its performance is also good. *The phone is super sleek and looks sexy . * The speaker grill is next to the charger port which outperforms and better than my coolpad note 3 which has speaker at the back and the sound gets effected when a put down coolpad. Cons : *They have given hybrid sim means that you can use dual sim or one sim and memory card. *The earphones and  chargers disappointed me a lot. When you'll see the look of the phone and then chargers and earphones . *The phone heats up, I think it is because of the metal body. *Battery is only 2600 mAh as Coolpad has 3000 mAh. Final Verdict : If you are not a hardcore gamer and want to have a phone which is packed with great specs and also looks great than it is perfect. I am not disappointed much because  you cannot get get the packed with some heavy specs and also looks great at this price then it is not possible.

17	chandansharma719	Jan 10, 2016	Yes	Smart phone in Smart price at Smart place at Snapdeal	Dear friends After experince 2 months of the use with this phone i just want to give some advantage and disadvantages Advantages: 1. Very best design and look 2. Awesome picture quality 3. The joy of full hd on a big screen 4. Sound quality is very good 5. Storage capacity is very good  Disadvantages 1. Only disadvantage is the       Processor of only 1.5 ghz which       Causes the slow processing of        Application like contacts, whatsapp etc.  So after describe all at last i will recommend it to all to buy this product. Service of snapdeal is Very satisfactory. In my opinion processor should be more powerfull for great performance.

62	praveen	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	GORGIOUS PHONE	EXCELLENT PHONE WITH ALL FACILITIES,good android phone ,not chinese made
63	Saurabh	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	This is an amazing phone!	Never reviewed anything else before. Reviewing this because I am very happy with the purchase.  Got it a week back for my mom. I am an iphone 6 user and this phone is more or less identical to an iphone 6 plus, only way more lighter than even my iphone 6. I went through extensive research, checked out xiaomi mi4i, lenovo k3 note and all others but finally got it because of the looks of the phone. Here is my review:  Pros: Sturdy build with all metal Excellent look and feel Very light Excellent screen quality with very fast touch Very good and basic UI with no useless apps Above average back camera (although very good in daylight)  Very good front 8 MP camera (way better than my iphone 6) The SAR values are clearly mentioned and well under standard Very decent interface, got antutu score of 30785 Good response from customer care whenever you call them Excellent call clarity  Cons: Only one speaker so speaker volume is on the average side, i.e. not loud Very small wire with the usb charger Bad quality earphones along with the handset  Overall: After experiencing this phone, the first thing I asked myself is why on earth are these iphones so costly when this american brand is giving almost the same thing for one-fifth of the price.
64	Dinesh parmar	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	Superb	Wow... Great phone I like the camera result very much
65	Hemu	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	awasome Phone	This is perfect phone on this range.... I would to tell  if you are searching under 10000 range mobile then go for this mobile.. Sound quality is perfect.

67	karuna292	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	very nice product	very good, only con is having a hybrid sim slot
68	roshan99390	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	R o s h a n	Super duper awesome phone camera quality is very good
69	Santhosh	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	Everything is fine! But Sim	Actually the phone was mentioned in dual ans Sim Tray is 1Nano sim and 2 one is SD or Nano Sim Ever..............................
70	jaganhjp	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	Infocus M535 - 1 dedicated sim and 1 hybrid sim.	I just got the handset today.   I tried to insert my sims and SD card, but to my disappointment, it has 1 dedicated sim slot and 1 hybrid sim slot (you can use either a sim or SD card).  Both Infocus and Snapdeal did not mention this on their sites.  Merely saying 16 gb memory that can be expanded by additional 64 gb by memory card is indeed misleading.  It is at the cost of a second sim. I have not tried this phone and therefore am unwilling to make a review; maybe it is too good for those who are happy with just a sim and a SD card. It looks great otherwise.
71	Rahil	Nov 05, 2015	Yes	Infocus 535 Gold Variant	Got the delivery today, mobile is too good in looks. Very Slim and Stylish, premium look  Cameras are excellent both front and back. Got excellent images outdoors and indoors compared to other phone cameras in the same price segment  Smooth and buttery touch  Display is good, InLife UI is up to expectations has many configurable options.  Performance is good no lags observed, have to check with high end games though.  All in all recommended phone
