I wouldn't have purchased it when it was 35 -40 k plus , not because of quality but only because the price was too much for me.  Currently have more then 18 apps installed and the phone works just as awesome as a phone works on day one you get it new. Had this been an android , with a gb ram and quad core processor , it will just start dying within first 2 days of purchase.  Dont listen to all the critics, I have come a long way using most expensive android and windows phone and I can guarantee you that you cant get this sort of experience in any other OS

498	James	Jun 02, 2015	Yes	This is Rocking!!!	After years of torture using Android, symbian and windows phone ( galaxy , lumia ) finally I got what every phone user deserves in the first place.  it's not just a phone , but a peace of mind. Such a smooth and fast user experience that is unmatched with any of it's rival companies.  Also at the current price it's just a killer. I wouldn't have purchased it when it was 35 -40 k plus , not because of quality but only because the price was too much for me.  Currently have more then 18 apps installed and the phone works just as awesome as a phone works on day one you get it new. Had this been an android , with a gb ram and quad core processor , it will just start dying within first 2 months of purchase.  Dont listen to all the critics, I have come a long way using most expensive android and windows phone and I can guarantee you that you cant get this sort of experience in any other OS  This is my first iphone and I am using it for past 10 days and I am quiet happy with it. PROS- 1 Good battery life ( my usage is very low ) 2 Excellent retina display. 3 Good sound quality an alternate for an ipod. 4 Best touch interface I have ever used. 5 Better build quality ( no plastic feel ) 6 Superb camera. CONS- 1 No direct access to the inbuilt memory on connecting with PC. Apart from that I am quiet happy with the iphone 4s and the service experience provided by Snapdeal,thanks and keep it up.

First time I have desided to buy IPhone and after getting this phone I can confidently say that it's my right decision.  After using this phone approx one month writing this review.  PROS:- Aswm design, touch is so  smooth works perfectly, clear display BEST THING:- battery backup of this phone is Aswm and very clear sound quality. Really very much happy with these two qualities.  CONS:- can't connect to your laptop directly, back side of this phone attract finger print very fastly, little much heavier.  OVERALL:- you can buy it without thinking anything. I m using this phone from approx one month and fully impressed with  this phone till now this doesn't hang up for a second also. And when we are getting brand like Apple at this rate then y we go for the other once.  Don't think what type of phone we get on snapdeal used or unused. Don't think much more just trust snapdeal u will only get brand new phone with original seal packing.

574	chandu	May 15, 2015	Yes	its perfect process to take the things from Snapdeal	great service and quick responce would be make more better service,
575	nitesh	May 15, 2015	Yes	good feeling for snapdeal	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

580	ruchit	May 15, 2015	Yes	Very good!	Good product ,cheap price (couldn't get it cheap elsewhere), great service(received with a minor defect although a new one the best thing being Snapdeal people offered to replace it promptly but the minute defect can be ignored in the sway of delight of using the best product at least price as the quality says everything) and what else u need when you are getting it with 1 year brand warranty. It's just a supplementary experience for me as I personally have had many such great experiences in the past also only on Snapdeal!  Cheers!!
581	monty	May 14, 2015	Yes	GOod	Product is good but not happy with the te taken by the courier service to deliver
582	ram the lover	May 14, 2015	Yes	love to use it	It's good to use as it contains many apps which u don't have to download from other site
583	Sanju	May 14, 2015	Yes	Just awesome	Amazing device by apple. Amazing ratina display with smoothest touch out there nice battery and application support is outstanding. It's a style statement and no other phone can beat it or compare it. I used 30 or something android and windows phones but i truly satisfied by this amazing device.
584	Babita Paul	May 14, 2015	Yes	Average, Ordinary	Great phone, apart from brand value awesome picture quality and sound, apt foir taking selfie. But the phone gets heated up very fast while talking and while charging.
585	Saurabh	May 14, 2015	Yes	Apple iphone 4s is a very good mobile	this phone is very good ,i like this

588	gk	May 14, 2015	Yes	iPhone is my branded phone	Once I have started using iPhone, I can't imagine of an alternate
589	honey	May 14, 2015	Yes	parfect online shopping app.	This mobile is amazing .
590	Rocky	May 14, 2015	Yes	APPLE the name is enough......	The iPhone 4S is a good-looking piece of kit. I'm writing for a black model, but there is also a white model available.It still looks and feels expensive, and, while it's thicker than the newer iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s models, it's still only 9.3mm (the iPhone 5s is just 7.6mm thick). It does feel heavier though, at 140 grams.The iPhone 4S has a 3.5in display. I find that the smaller display means the iPhone 4s fits in my pocket nicely, and is easy to carry around. Of course, there are disadvantages to having the smaller screen, but that's not a big deal. The iPhone 4S has a complete glass back. The iPhone 4S 3.5in display is 960-by-640 pixels, with a screen resolution of 326 pixels per inch, making it Retina standard. The rear-facing camera in the iPhone 4S is an 8-megapixel iSight camera. It has an f/2.4 aperture and can shoot 1080p video. Apple's iPhone 4S is powered by an Apple-designed dual-core A5 processor. iPhone 4S can handle most of the tasks I want to carry out swiftly, but if speed is top of your priority list then the iPhone 4S probably isn't for you. Apple claims that the iPhone 4S provides up to eight hours of talk time on 3G, up to 200 hours on standby, up to six hours of 3G internet browsing or up to nine hours of WiFi internet browsing. But without doubt, iPhone 4S needs to be charged every day. Pros Cheaper than iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s Can run iOS 7 Cons Smaller display than iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s Poor battery life
591	Sagar	May 12, 2015	Yes	Apple is apple..	No one can beat the apple. The iPhone 4S is the benchmark of apple's new designed edition phone. Clear sound quality, never hangs up like android phones. A class marking phone image (showoff), feels awesome. Fits in budget thanks to snapdeal for nice deals. Atleast you can trust the snapdeal for this type of products. But there are some cons too that you can not use the Bluetooth for exchange the stuff. also can not do much as you can with android devices. Overall apple is apple. Must buy if you are a class conscious person..

627	loganathan	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Awesome Phone in Good Price Range  Advantages of iPhone 4S :       iPhone 4S using Apple A5 processor 1GHz dual-core processors along with dual-core GPU. Apple said the new chipset will make the iPhone 4S work faster 2-fold, and the image display 7 times faster than the iPhone 4.      Batteries are more durable. 8 hours of talk time with 3G networks and 14 hours with 2G networks. 6 hours of browsing with 3G network and 6 hours with Wi-Fi network. 10 hours to watch the video and 40 hours for listening to music.     The camera in the iPhone 4S to 8-megapixels in the iPhone 4 compared with 5-megapixel camera. camera in the iPhone 4S is also equipped with autofocus, flash, f2 / 4. Apple says that the camera on the iPhone 4S work 33% faster than the camera on the iPhone 4.     Software in use on the iPhone 4S adalaah IOS 5. Latest operating system from Apple.     Siri, a voice command technology. Special features that only exist in the iPhone 4S allows users schedule meetings, find nearby restaurants, to know the weather just by voice commands.   Disadvantages iPhone 4S :      Design no difference between the iPhone 4S with the iPhone 4.     The absence of a large screen. many people expect Apple will release iPhone screen that their bigger rivals like Android.     Can not be in use in 4G networks.     Differences battery life is not too large in comparison with the previous battery.        It seems iPhone 4S does not bring many changes to the previous iPhone, the iPhone 4.

630	Ashutosh Gupta	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Awsome Work..	I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
631	Arjekn	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Apple privileges at low cost	At this price point iPhone 4 s is the best option. Pros-best camera,best app ecosystem,best looks.

728	Emmu	Feb 05, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone at best price !	I was checking all the online shopping websites to find the best price for iPhone 4S and I finally found it on Snapdeal. The phone is 100 % genuine and brand new.  I've seen some pictures and news articles and also posts on FB stating that they ordered an iPhone and they receive a brick or something. Its all fake guys, I've ordered it and I've received a genuine phone which is brand new. Its just that haters want to degrade the name of Snapdeal.  Anyways, overall I'm very happy with the phone and Snapdeal services, it was a gift for my mom and she loved it.  PS: You can also check the images that I've included with it. :)
729	Murthy	Feb 05, 2015	Yes	Good one	Received the phone in sealed original iphone box. I feel 8 GB memory is too small, so I would recommend with 16 or 32GB.
730	Sumeet	Feb 05, 2015	Yes	Excellent product at best price	So far so good. The phone is original and works absolutely fine. Snapdeal offering is the best across online stores but the apple website mentions only Fliipkart to be their only  online authorized partner. May make you a little wary but that's OK as long as Snapdeal is selling this product with Apple India warranty, you should be fine.

734	Manikkandan R	Jan 21, 2015	Yes	4S with more Plus	With 5 months usage, i will say it as the perfect phone with best features and definitely it added credits to my appearance.   Pros: 1.Best look....Black colour has more sexy look that too when display screen in off condition. 2.Better performance...Work smoothly even when more than 20 app opened in background 3.Awesome Camera...I personally found that in quality aspect that 16mp of other phone can never with even iphone's 8mp 4.Good battery life...Few of my friends told that battery life is not good before i bought. But personally i find that it can stand for 24hr when you charge in proper cycle. After watching a full 2.5hr movie, more than 40% charge will be left in phone. I installed app to maintain proper charging cycle.  Cons: 1.Data Transfer : Synchronization is required every time to exchange data between system and phone...its a great headache when to want transfer a song or data instantly from any other system without iphone software installation. 2.Low Alert sound: As compared to other phone alert sound is low but for watching movie and you tube videos it has better sound. 3.Unique Charging port: Need to carry the charging port everywhere i go as its design is unique. General Universal cable can not be used to charge. 4.Glass finish: Both side of the phone is finished with glass so need to be handled with care.

746	five46	Jan 15, 2015	Yes	The Birthday Gift	At the outset, apologies for writing a review after ages from the date of purchase. No, never really got time for this.  Bought this as a birthday gift for my Missus in August 2014.  The packaging was very nice and the product was delivered within the promised date.  I was totally new to the apple eco-system and so was my wife. She was using the Sony Sola prior to this phone.  She does photography as a hobby with her Canon DSLR. So, she knows a thing or two about the lenses. She was really impressed with the camera onboard of the 4s.  Apart from that, she's got used to the apple ecosystem pretty quickly and is happy with the overall performance. She doesn't use any resource hungry app nevertheless. Basic telephony, google search for images, whatsapp, Candy crush and a couple more arcade games are what finds use on her phone. Battery lasts a day easily for her usage apparently.  To sum up, she's very happy with her birthday gift and the phone performs flawlessly as I write this review.

780	StOuen	Nov 26, 2014	Yes	One of the best iPhones	If you are not a heavy duty smart-phone user deep into gaming or photography then this is an excellent model for you. With iCloud integration you dont need to worry too much about running out of space. In terms of build quality and reliability the 4s is one of the best ever models of the iPhone. No "bendgates" here. And now it comes at a delicious price point enough to make even the fence sitters hungry. Battery life is not great though. So, take this into consideration when you decide to buy it.
781	Abhi	Nov 14, 2014	Yes	Good Phone at this price range	Good Phone at this price range

942	Guest	Jul 24, 2014	No	I just love this phone ..!!	I realized what apple is after owning an iphone 4s and why its a craze among people . none of my friends have an apple as they think its a stupid waste of money. I myself has used every single brand of phones and operating systems. from Nokia to HTC and from Windows phone to Blackberry OS. but what amazed me is the iOS and its simplicity. even if its fast its very simple to use and the interface is something that even a child can understand. Camera is awesome , though not the best but doesn't disappoint you when you are in low light. Phone is practical and easy to use because of a 3.5 inch screen and small dimensions and like other costly smartphones doesn't require two hands at a time. Very well built body and smooth simple looks,and the apple logo just adds a charm to the back panel. The only problem is memory. As i bought a 16 GB model it though seems to be enough but after around 500 photographs and music you will definitely wish you would have got a bit more. Battery backup is decent. And in just simple words, we get it because it an iphone...  all in all this phone is worth every penny.If u love to love your phone and cant live without it, go for apple, you wont be dissapointed ...
