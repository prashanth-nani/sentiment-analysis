2	Anil Singh	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	good product	good product
3	Aji	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	Good phone with very good features two disappointing things are FM radio is not stereo , headphone port is  not fully compatible with Nokia, Samsung  headphones.My previous iball phone Andi 3.5r also had the same headphone port issue.However headphone ports of iball tablets are found to be universal and is compatible with all type of headphones .Panther is kitkat and hope iball will release lollipop version soon for this device.This device is otg enabled so hope iball will make Play Store Application (PPP Widget2) available for download for this device. Camera , earpiece ,speaker and tele calls are found to be impressive . Overall the device satisfies most tele computing needs. Worth buying
4	SURESH	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	GOOD FOR VALUE!	This my IInd 5 inch Phone.It is very good to use.Camera is very good and take good quality pictures.All apps are gud.Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use.I think in this device battery power can be used above 3000mah.
5	San	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	Budget Phone with premium features	Pros:  Wonderful Budget phone Good graphics quality. Octa core processor. 52 fps frame speed( good for gaming). 8 Mega Pixel Back camera. 2 Megapixel front camera  Cons:   1900mAH battery is not  good enough for a 5 inch screen phone with so many features.( Only 26 hrs to drain out the total charge after full recharge). it might go down further if the data connection/ wi-fi is enabled  Uses:  A high end phone with limted battery backup
