1	www.suryasurya.ss	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Avenger arun	Its very nice because it is very  big screen  awesome mobile
2	Milind	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Excellent Phone	I searched many smartphones in low price segment. But, I didn't get best specs as InFocus M370i have. Its the best phone in this low price. Besides, price on snapdeal is also good. Handset is not heating in any of the operating condition. Quality and speed is good. Mat finish from back side provides more grip to hold in hand and prevents scratches like glossy finish does. I like it..
3	rakeshdarji89	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Excellent Product	viry nice mobile
4	user	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	not happy with sim2 slot	there is hybrid slot for sim2 we cannot use memory card and sim at a time
5	Cherry	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Wow Its Working Amazing	I purchaed  Infocus M370i 4G 8GB  Its Working Very Good
6	BigBoss	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	Better phone at this price	The phone looks good, sleek and light. I didn't expect this much thin phone and light weight. When you open the back cover, plastic material does not look premium and just a like a China phone.Exterior wise, the phone looks pretty good, very compact/handy for a 5 inch phone. I feel the touch is not that much good in some spots. Not sure all face the same issue. May be they should have worked in touch sensitivity more. Remember, if you want to use SD card, then you cannot use the dual sim, it is hybrid sim type. OS/UI is good, it gives more option like CMOD. Camera quality is also good. I bought this for my sister and I own an Yureka Plus. I feel, Infocus 8MP camera is far far better then Yureka's 13MP. Go for it, if your budget is less then 5000.

216	gsaurabh90	Jan 29, 2016	Yes	Yes i Got Android Marshmallow i.e Android 6.0   :)	Well the phone looks pretty good from the face or front, but pathetic & cheap from the rear(slimness lies within the cheap plastic used at the back cover). Hardware looks pretty on paper but lags a bit in real life scenario, apps take some time while loading since it has A7 processor , so dont expect more. Screen is 720 p but if you look at the screen for some time you find some diagonal lines which shows that the display used is cheap( and it doesn't appear to be capacitive but pretty much resistive ). Camera is average, color looks saturated and blurry at times , front cam is somewhat better than the rear one. Battery wise i am satisfied with the device, it gives more than 1 day of backup on normal use since it has 2230 mah battery , and low power processor.    Pros:- 1. Large display with 720p . 2. Latest Android 6.0 i.e Marshmallow. 3. Sleek Design. 4. Good Battery. 5. Value for money, coz in mere 5000 bucks no brand is giving u 5 inch with 720p ,  1gb  of RAM,8 mp Camera & most important Android marshmallow.   Cons:- 1. Average Camera 2. Worst back look. 3. Poor FM reception. 4. Display feels resistive 5. Lags some times.   Verdict :- _________  If u have 1000 rs more then Xiaomi Redmi 2 is better option, but if u taste the newest version of android with cheap price then this phone is a good choice. :)

307	mechgaurav	Jan 07, 2016	Yes	Nice Phone	Got it for a friend who was just crazy for a cheap 4G phone, although he stays at a location where even 3G has issues. Built quality is sturdy and feels solid in hands. A good buy

316	Rishabh	Jan 05, 2016	Yes	Great phone at this price range	First of all at this price range, no phone can replace this one. Pros- Great performance. No lag at all. The snapdragon chip works extremely well. Cameras are excellent. Photos are brought and sharp enough and are very clear. The main attract is the display. It has a full HD display that makes it catchy as the screen never gets blur from any angle. The build is also quite good. It is good for rough users like me. Battery backup is mind blowing. The battery lasts around for 7-10 hours on continuous net usage. The plus is the 4G that makes it future secure. The big surprise is the marshmallow update that I got as soon as i received the phone.   Cons- Well there are few Cons but well they are negligible. The second Sim slot is a problem but for me it is nothing because i am a single Sim user.  I recommend everybody to buy this because this Infocus phone will never disappoint you.
317	rajaditya5327	Jan 05, 2016	Yes	Very poor Processorr	I am not satisfied with the product.  Because it has very bad processor.  I have download just games in the moblie and the mobile becomes slow...... Very SLOW....

483	saurabhmech87	Dec 03, 2015	Yes	infocus m370i mobile is just ok	product is good.............but one drawback is its second sim slot that you can place ther either sim or sd card. i you place ther SD card then this is like single sim handset.User memory is also less than 4GB  delivery service in allahabad is also not upto the mark. dilveryman have to inform before reaching the destination so that they can receive item easily.

486	Sachin	Dec 03, 2015	Yes	Infocus Mobile M370i	Basic level smart phone. One advantage is 4G ready.  Smart and slim body and I got white phone which looks pretty good. White back on black front with the white frame. Lots of pre installed apps and hence out of 1GB memory (RAM) only 200-300MB RAM available.  Front camera ok. Back camera good. Charging takes bit more time but ok and on normal use battery lasts for 8 hrs. Bit high drain on playing video or games. Video /Camera (Back) pretty good.  Voice quality is good (for call and headphone) and have the option of equalizer for the music lovers.  Nice choice for a first time buyer.

620	Tarique Anwer	Nov 20, 2015	Yes	Best smartphone in this price range.	PROS- 1. Slim and light weight 125g- looks and feel great, easy to hold and operate. 2. 5 inch HD display- clear and bright 3. Good battery backup 2230mAh- last about 1 day after full charge on normal use. 4. 4G connectivity- but I am still using 3G so I havenot any expirence about 4G 5. Android lollipop 5.1.1- supports most of the apps and games.  CONS- 1. Hybrid sim slot- this is a drawback of this phone, you have to choose one thing - dual sim connectivity or microsd card installation. 2. Poor performance- touch is not so good, it takes few seconds to open most of the function and sometime it lags like- while using internet, playing games and during calls. 3. Below average camera. 4. RAM ROM- ram should be 1.5gb and the 4gb of rom is used by system memory, user memory is only 4gb so it should be more. REVIEW-                I think that, this is a best smartphone at this price range. Because it has great and latest features. Newly launch in market, it is extra slim and lightweight. So I advise to go for this nice product.
621	sandy	Nov 19, 2015	Yes	perfect for this price	PROS-1gb ram,nearly 4gb usable out of 8 gb internal memory,4g availability,good battery standby period,good quality rear camara 8 MP,light weight,smooth touch  CONS-ok frnt cam of 2 MP,no screen guard so u have to buy it,little heating of battery when gaming for more time   OVERALL-good phone at cheap cost
