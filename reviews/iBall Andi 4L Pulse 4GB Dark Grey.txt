5	S Mahaboob Basha	Mar 20, 2016	Yes	Iball andy mobile	Very gud because, my mobile got repair after one month of purchase.  I went to customore care. the mobile was sent to Hyderabad or Mumbai I don't know.  After few days I got a message that, the mobile cannot be repaired.  A new mobile will be replaced in the place of my mobile.   So I thank u to snapdeal for its care. Love to shop on snapdeal.

10	aj	Mar 20, 2016	Yes	Great phone in this range	Pretty good phone. I only hope they ugrade it to Windows 10. Please note, this phone has no call recording option.
11	Arka Banerjee	Sep 27, 2015	Yes	Great. Cant be better.	As i have used lumia i know what windows is. nice entry to windows by iball. the phone has many pros 1.windows 8.1 so no lag whatsoever 2.1 gm ram is a boon.  3.Quadcore snapdragon processor made the phone super fast. can handle almost all types of app and games.  4.Call or voice quality is loud and clear  update the phone to windows 8.1 update 2 and the phone becomes more awesome. folders can be created. cortana comes on. settings menu gets greatly organised  Back camera quality is ok can be improved by iball Front vga camera is ok ok in daylight only  the only pros is the internal 4gb memory out of which 1.5 gb is free and the rest is occupied by the os. sd card can be addes. move all your app to sd card or install apps or games directly into the sd card. store video or photos in sd card to make most of the inbuilt memory. apps and games can be moved to sd card like android.   overall a great phone if you ar planning to buy a windows smartphone go for it. it has overything office, onedrive, cortana.

29	Mandeep	Aug 29, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone	This is my first Windows device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use..  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung, Microsoft Lumia or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 3k - 5k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

46	guest	Jul 20, 2015	Yes	Cheapest windows phone ever seen	This phone is the cheapest windows phone available in the market. It has got good specifications and available cheaply. The performance of the phone is very good. Even you can update it to next version available. Rear camera is just ok. Loudspeaker voice is less. It has got an excellent earphone with bass. I am giving 5/5 as the specifications are extremely high at this price. Initially battery backup was less but after updating to 8.1 gdr update 2 there was a commendable increase in the battery life.

59	guest	Jun 24, 2015	Yes	Joy of Shopping	My cousin bought this phone by using my snapdeal account! Truly which company provides you such product in this cost? Not much. iBall Andy 4L Pulse runs on Windows 8.1 platform so there's no problems of hanging and the net uses very little data for its apps and downloading. It has awesome 1GB RAM and good camera to capture your moments. About company's reliability, iBall is very trusted brand. I think this product is in your budget and will fulfill your expectations.
