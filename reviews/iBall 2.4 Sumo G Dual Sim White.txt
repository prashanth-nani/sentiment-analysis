5	y2jy2j	Mar 16, 2016	Yes	good phone at this price tag.	Does basic functions well and look is not bad either. I have been using it for 10 days now. Till now no issue. Reception is good, sound audible. Can not say about after sales service as I did not need it till date.
6	Bal	Mar 16, 2016	Yes	Not Perfect but Good	Just bought it from Snapdeal and the delivery was quick. The packaging was flawless as well. Coming onto the mobile, its a good-looking one and has ample juice in the battery as well. The only shortcoming that I found was in the music department. It was unable to detect the songs from memory card in the music player. And there is no other way to add them to the playlist. In other words, I have to play them from inside the file manager one by one.   Also, fm being wireless, it doesn't require earphones to be inserted but the loudspeaker couldnot be turned off even after inserting the earphones. I don't know if these problems are present in this particular handset or in all of them. But if you don't want any of these features then its a pretty good mobile.
