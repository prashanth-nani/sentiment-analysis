6	HTC One M8	Mar 12, 2016	Yes	Awesome Purchase	The smartphone is for everyone who are heavy gamers, moderate - heavy users and photography enthusiast who can not afford to buy a dslr.  There may one or two ifs and buts, which are really nothing and don really matter. Stylish, powerful, handy,  the list goes on n on.
7	Amit	Mar 12, 2016	Yes	Once again HTC M8.....	Bought the same model couple of years back when it was newly launched . Had amazing experience having the phone unfortunately i lost the phone .  Explored the market but found none of the models matching the experience i had with  HTC M-8 so opted to go for buying M-8 again at a perfect value of 21500/- . Happy to have M-8 again at a superb price and express delivery... Cheersss

20	am	Nov 16, 2015	Yes	Nice product	This product is very nice to use . Though it misses some of the features which the m8 has like ir blaster and nfc. Overall its a power packed android phone with an intelligent camera. Do go for this phone if you are ok with the missing features.

25	Marcus the magnificent	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	Smart phones doesnt gets any better then this.	This is the best android phone I've ever owned, you don't get any more features at such affordable price. I'm extreamly delighted by the phone's performance. If you have the budget then you can't get a better phone then this. Processor works smoothly, I've not experienced lag while multitasking. This phone is simply crafted to perfection.
26	Kunal	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	Five star	This is great phone
27	karan	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	East or West hTC is the best	The HTC One (M8) (Review | Pictures) is a critically acclaimed device with an iconic design. However, quite a few critics, professional and otherwise, have panned its UltraPixel camera, since competing smartphones take better pictures. HTC's idea was to use a camera sensor with fewer but larger pixels, to capture more light per pixel, but this didn't impress many people. The company then tried to make up for it with another idea, Duo Camera, which used a second lens to capture 3D depth information and enable new photographic tricks. When reviewing the One (M8), we found it to be more gimmicky than actually useful.  Thankfully, HTC has been listening to all the feedback. At a recent press meet in Mumbai, a top executive at the Taiwanese company stated that HTC might have oversold the UltraPixel concept.
28	Anshu	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	great product .	box was properly sealed and untampered in any way which is the first concern . the product was totally as displayed ....so far I haven't found anything worth complaining about the phone ...it's a delight to shop through snapdeal.
29	sameeroo	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	HTC ONE M8 EYE	The best phone i have had , amazing speed , zero lag unlike most phones and amazing sound and build quality
30	Amit	Oct 24, 2015	Yes	I loved shopping from Snapdeal	This phone is perfect and i dont have to tell you anything more about HTC One M8. & Great shopping experience from snapdeal with cheapest price.
31	htcmaniac	May 15, 2015	Yes	Excellent condition ,great phone	It's one the best brands of the world in this market, and it has provided a masterpiece once again for its growing reputation in Indian market. Superb phone everything is perfect. Totally satisfied .
32	APURV	May 15, 2015	Yes	m8 eye	Design:beautifully crafted just like the m8. slippery though,but the metal looks great and feels great in hand Display:coming from s4,i do miss the punchy colors and the outdoor visibility is only average,still colors are accurate and vivid(4/5) Performance:no lags throughout the interface,never a stutter,handles games well,snapdragon 801 is one great processor and the light skin on android certainly helps,gotta love sense 6 Camera:an underperformer,shutter speed is good and noise is kept low but colors are quite oversaturated and low light is certainly not the best,still day to day usage is pretty good and manual controls help Battery:i installed gsam battery manager to check screen on time,i disabled unnecessary apps and turned location off,at around 30% brightness and continuous browsing and light gaming and whatsapp,always gives me 4 and a half to 5 hours of screen on time,awesome stuff,though standby time is not great,however no complaints Sound:its HTC,audio output via headphones is the best i've experienced,the best and trust me guys, this is the first thing i want in a phone,via the speakers is loud and clear,awesome stuff HTC,plus the front speakers make so much sense CONS:no NFC,no IR port unlike the original m8,still no news about the lollipop update,i have asked htc india questions on twitter and facebook but they just don't reply,while the original m8 has been already updated to lollipop,the camera lens on the back of the phone is very very prone to scratches,you should better cover it with some skin
33	Rupesh	May 15, 2015	Yes	Great phone to use	Worth every penny that you spend on it. I have been using this device for about a month and only con that I have observed till now is it gets heated when we are on video call for about 1 hour, and this may be accounted for its outstanding 5MP front camera. Battery backup is very good, lasts for one full day with normal 3G data usage.
34	kulu	May 15, 2015	Yes	nice	superb cover nd good sarvice snapdeal
35	babudivi	May 15, 2015	Yes	Classic HTC One M8!!!	It is a Wow!!! Snap deal has again made it perfect!!!Tks!
36	Vinay	May 15, 2015	Yes	Looks Good, But not as good as the M8	The front side around the speaker does not look as good as the M8, its black instead of the the gunmetal. This phone is good but the M8 is better.
37	The tech geek	May 15, 2015	Yes	Cheapest price at snapdeal	The only way to buy the phone cheapest is at snapdeal, the delivery was earlier than expected actually . The device is amazing . Value for money buy it with the dot cover if u can . Will really bring out the best from the device. Love the screen. The only thing wrong is that the phone heats up but its with heavy gaming so expected.
38	Gupta	May 15, 2015	Yes	Phone in excellent condition The cell	the cell phone I am happy with the performance. purchased by me is an excellent condition and was made available to me promptly. The communication from the company right from placing the order till delivery was excellent. Price was much lower than market.
39	SM	May 15, 2015	Yes	Good but no match to BlackBerry	Heavy users of mail on BlackBerry platform may struggle..decide carefully. Otherwise a good phone. May go for it.
