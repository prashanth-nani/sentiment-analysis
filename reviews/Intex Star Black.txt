5	Raghu dhore	Oct 11, 2015	Yes	good use it	is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from
