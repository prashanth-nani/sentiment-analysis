34	Rahul	Mar 22, 2016	Yes	Issue with camera	Performance wise this phone is good. But when it comes to camera quality then it lags behind mi phones. During daylight the quality is good but during night the picture quality is very bad. Also only single sim slot is 3G and 4G supported. And second sim slot is only 2G supported.   For advance users who would like to root the phone will get difficulty in finding custom roms. Custom roms are easily availabe for different micromax mobiles, but for this phone hardly u will find any custome rom.

207	subrata	Feb 15, 2016	Yes	Better than its price tag.	Well if you looking for a low budget mobile that meets your day to day need from high social networking  to high end gaming then stop here.   Dazen 1 is  thin, very rich in look, fast enough thanks to 2 go ram surely u will not experience even a single lag.  Battery back up is decent surely give u a single day on continuous net connected. Other features are similar  to other mobile on this budget.  One problem that I found is app can not be moved to SD card perhaps its Kitkat OS problem.  And if you need a personal bodyguard for your I - phone or S5 or for 30k budget phone for rough usage , high end gaming etc,  u can go for it.  In one word it worth enough to gift it to your gf considering you have no guts to focus your eyeball on i-phone.

I've been using this mobile for 1 week... all are perfect.. advantages:1)2 GB RAM.. 2)5 inches HD display (display clarity is more better than other smartphones).. 3)excellent call clarity and speaker quality which means can hear the sound without noise..4)excellent camera quality and features 8mp+5mp(Note:the mobile provided camera app gives avg photo shots.. so,u should have to use HD camera app that gives you an amazing camera clarity with sharpness).. 6)battery backup is an excellent,thereby it can stay upto 1.5 days in moderate using.7)4G is exciting feature for this price. .u Can choose other launchers also by clear default launchers(storage >apps>all> launcher>clear defaults).. Disadvantages:1)phone memory is 8GB only eventhough,by using the SD card can get more storage..2)running with Android kitkat.. as soon as possible to get lollipop.. No headset provided.. I recommend you to buy this..

480	Poobathy D	Dec 30, 2015	Yes	Best Phone in this Price Segment	I have been using this phone past one week. Good Snapdeal Delivery and Packing. Until now there is no problem at all in any of its available features.   In the Package:  1) Handset, Charging Adapter, USB Cable, User manual and Warranty Card. (No Headphone, Scratch card included.)  I am a beginner user of this mobile, hence,  this is a primary review of this phone. Display: Very Good Display with well responsive touch sensitivity.  Processing: With 1.2 GHz Quad Core Processor and 2 GB RAM, Applications running smooth, If you are High end Game lover then you need external SD Card Support (Internal Memory 8 GB: 3.5 GB Usable).  Camera: Average 8 MP Rear Camera &  Good 5 MP Front Camera. bad and noisy pictures when captured in low light.   Design: Looks like more than 10K priced mobiles. and Built Quality: Good.  Call: Good Signal Capturing, Better Call Quality, call forwarding, auto Call record options available.  Battery: 2500 mAh, stay upto 18 hours moderate usage.  OS: Little disappointment that it comes with Android 4.4 Kitkat, yet no updates are available to upgrade to 5.0 Lollipop.  UI : Need more works on Cool UI, Not Satisfied with available themes.  LED lights for Capacitive Buttons, Notification LED for Apps, Battery, Message are one more feather to its cap.  Lets see pros and cons.  Pros: 1) 5 inch 720p Display. 2) 2 GB RAM. 3) Dual SIM with Seperate Slots for SD Card ( 1st SIM supports upto 4G, 2nd SIM 2G only) 4) Transfer Apps to External Storage. 5) Different LED Notification Lights.  Cons: 1) No Android 5.0 2) 2nd SIM is not supports 3G or 4G, its only 2G. (But ok for the price) 3) No Pendrive OTG Support.  Finally, it worth for price.

592	jay	Dec 11, 2015	Yes	amazingly awesome	well i am using this one from two months and hadn't seen any problem till date, the coolpad UI interface is easy for users to use well much similar to other chinese phones but getting 4g, and two gb ram in this price segment is really makes this phone awesome, dual sim and separate place for microsd card unlike mi4i, meizu m2 note you can use both sim and micro sd card at same time  the only two things where they can improve is camera and battery but if you are not a gamer or multitasker this battery of around 2500 ma will easily last long for a single day , when you comes to camera when you compared with redmi 2 it lacks the clearity bt to be honest in this price segment  what else we want. so if you want all specs phone in lower price this one not dissappoint anyone so guys you can buy this one!!!!!!!

And most importantly it does not have the heating problem like redmi 2. The only thing that is lacking is its camera but that is also not bad. You could have good shots and the videos . from camera is good. I am satisfied with the product. Thanks to snapdeal

639	DIVYAJEET	Nov 30, 2015	Yes	simply the supreme	In a tight market of  today..... i had  a budget of 5-6k for a good phone.... ootions were plenty..... but its the 95 per cent postiive reviews..... which attracted me towards these Chinese giant smartphone company..... earlier i had used  the spice coolpad Mi 515 which was a spectacular phone too.  This was the second one  I ordered.... earlier i had bought one for my sister.   The display is awesome..... clear and crisp contrast The speakers work fine and give quality output.... but the  sound gets muffled when phone is  placed  upside down  No  heating issues so far.....  except when you  take lengthy videos.  No lag.... the processor works fine.... thanks to  snapdragon 410 chipset The 2 gb Ram is the killer thing in this budget phone ....from which  u will get a about 1.2 gb usable  Internal storage  is 4.4 gb avaliable to users  Some ppl said that  they  cant install  apps to sd card..... let me clear the doubt..... u can install an app directly to  sd card but you cant move an app installed in  phone storage  to  sd card The camera is magnificent..... maybe low light or day light.... it takes stunning pics..... front camera is crisp as well.... what attracts more  is the  shutter speed.... very good.  Battery  life is  another strong point about this handset.... works 1 and a half day for me.... great The look and feel is  premium.... no worries at all.    I you ppl are confused between yuphoria and this phone....  this is  not a heating giant like  yuphoria.... and this  phone  has  satisfied all most  all of its customers    ALL OVER.....  IT WAS A GREAT PURCHASE..... THANKS SNAPDEAL AND COOLPAD..... THE BEST IN THIS BUDGET

642	Dave	Nov 29, 2015	Yes	Coolpad Dazen1 4g	This is a nice android  phone with its superb specifications. Using it for about a week and the mobile is a userfriendly gadget. The cool UI may take one or two days to get adjust with, but nothing difficult there. Though minor, I would suggest Coolpad to correct the wrongly marked SIM slots. Both cameras are good, nice touch response, better battery, no voice dropping and a good looking, capable phone. Dazen1 4g is cheap, but the cheapness confined only in its price. Its really a very good phone to have and flaunt
643	irfan.khan.pathan.27	Nov 29, 2015	Yes	Very perfect	Best mobile in low price..  Screen is so nice..... Very fast working....Bettery back is long...... Camara results so clean and nice

646	KD	Nov 29, 2015	Yes	Very good phone in this price range	I like this phone. It is indeed a good deal in this price range. I recommend this phone to others......................
647	Puni	Nov 29, 2015	Yes	Good mobile	Good mobile.......... Worth for money........ Good service....... Easy buy...... Also camera is good quality..... Happy to use.....
648	N.Sharma	Nov 29, 2015	Yes	Fantastic phone	I bought the phone second time without any re thinking, for my cousin. That too I waited for 15 days,  till the stock arrived. Let me tell the pros and cons of the phone PROS 1. Display is very good, as I have played many full HD Videos. Angle of viewing is also large 2. Nearly 1.2GB of RAM is available after reboot. So phone multi tasking is very smooth. 3.Although I am not a game lover, I have played few games without out any hiccups. 4. I am using an airtel 4G Sim, so browsing speed and downloading is super fast, I have downloaded full HD movies within few minutes. 5. Front camera clarity is super. I can take very good selfies. Back camera is also good, although it is not up to the mark.  CONS 1. There is slight heating near back camera lens during browsing. I feel this is common in all Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. 2. Back camera performance is little poor in low lights. 3. No gorilla glass protection  But keeping in mind the budget, 6k, the above cons can be forgotte. So only I purchased the phone second time for my cousin.   So friends if you want a good phone with in the 6k budget, you can go for coolpad dazen 1 without any hesitation.

654	sumit kumar kushwaha	Nov 27, 2015	Yes	this is my first android phone ,so this phone is good result and best camera quility.	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

666	Nihar	Nov 26, 2015	Yes	Honest review for Coolpad Dazen 1 4G mobile	I had ordered this phone during the pre-Diwali electronic sale. I paid some 5200 INR with shipping. The delivery from SD was faster than expected and packaged perfectly. Good work SD! For the phone:  - The screen is bright (though not the brightest in outdoor conditions). Resolution is good at HD  - The speed is good with 2 GB RAM - no lags, no app-hanging  - The phone is light and battery is good for an average day's usage  - Camera is good during day, below average during night  - Can't comment on the after sales-service as never had to visit one yet (and hope I dont have to !)   Overall the phone is very good for the given price range. Coolpad is making its mark in India and I think it provides better price options for same specs as other companies.

749	Mr. Kotian Lund	Nov 19, 2015	Yes	7 days of happiness - as good as any under 10k	After 7 days of use I am very happy with this phone. Went from the YU Yureka and my experience is better on the Dazen 1. No issues, no lagging, no errors, it just work. Ok google voice control works a lot better, cannot say why.   Compared to the Redmi competitor I went for this as it has no skin and 2GB ram - the skin i.e. the layer added on top of the basic android consumes on your ram and with only 1gb on the Redmi you get short very fast. The Dazen actually uses more than 1gb with the set up delivered, but still has lots of power.   For social media sharing the camera is good enough, consider the price on this one, no one can expect more. Good 5mp on the chat selfie camara an advantage if you use this a lot   For any phone under 10.000, this is as good as any. For me throwing my phones away all the time, this keeps the budget in black.
750	amir.bemech	Nov 19, 2015	Yes	Decent looking/performing	after a long study I decided to buy this . Thank god my time and money didnt get wasted.  Satisfied with its performance, camera, and battery backup. No heating/lagging issues at all , under any usage.  Only thing I regret is it's second sim slot supports only 2g. it will be great if it supports atleast 3g.

UI is pretty light and very handy  Cons- 1.no earphone , better no earphone than a crappy one.  2 . gets heated sometimes, tell me which one dont   So if your budget is around 5k to 7k it is the best choice you have... Trust me, I have ordered 14 of these and I have to  order more, it is in demand.

767	sundarthams	Nov 18, 2015	Yes	Genuine Review	I think I am fit enough to review this produce, as I   have two coolpad dazen 1 in my home.. Coolpad, I really salute u for this dazen1.. Its unbelievable to have such a configuration at this price.. Here I wanna list out some specialities of this produce.  Camera quality - my friends, having mobiles cost about 1and1.5k,are wondering.  Face lock Photos preview size can adjusted. So that 104 photos can be viewed in a single screen.  Inbuilt option for screen shot and screen record makes this produce unique.. No other phone below 15 k can be seen with this feature..  Battery backup lasts for 24 hrs in  Normal use. 10-12 hrs in progressive use...  Coolshow theme is also praiseworthy,  for it has 2 styles of home screen icon..  2 gb ram makes easy to run many apps.  The only lack and my request to the manufacturer to include,  is OTG SupSupport.. I vote 100 for coolpad dazen 1...

Pros Battery backup good Camera clarity superb 4G sim slot Storage 5.7gb for user internal Slim design Clear display Sound quality of out speaker is good at high volumes too. No burst of sound.  Performance Fully loaded internal and 16gb SD card still functions so smooth and no lags at all. No hanging issue.  Gaming Alphasat 8 n many other heavy games of 1.5gb are installed and run very smooth without a second lag. No delay in performance.  1380 x 12xx HD video played. No delay in frames.   Battery backup On a single charge it lasts for 18hours data always on and music player and calls.  Cons No gorrila glass so need for a tamper glass. No equalizer in default music player Flash can be made much better Phone gets heat if use continuously for long time.  I suggest this phone for gamers, heavy users bcz its a master piece at this price range.

874	Ankit Arpit	Nov 06, 2015	Yes	Perfet Compact Mobile	This is my 4th Dezen ITs amazing Superb Camara, processor, battery, Display. It is 5 on 5 . UI is also good bt recant app are not up to gr8. It is bit low like other android its is different .  Heating on playing heavy games bt no lag.  Same processor used in moto G 3rd gen,  honor 4X and many middle segment mobile so its plus point in very less rate.  Network is good bt not 5 star.  Battry backup is superb upto 7-8 hour uses. Cons...  No earphones and screen guard , no any screen protection like gorrila glass. No any addition sound app like dolbi atom in lenovo  and loudspeaker is also bit low. No lollypop. So enjoy at this price it is  10 on 10 .i hope dazen note 3 also launch on snapdeal soon

The Good   4g  2gb Ram  Not much heating issues  Cool UI Price Factor  The Average   Battery  Camera  Processor   Below Average  Plastic material used  Finish  After Sales Service  In the end , I would say that if you are looking for a decent performer in tight budget and got Fed up with boring UI of MI/Samsung and want some different than this is the one you can go for . If you are a heavy user or need to play games better increase your budget and look for other options with better processors . Hope this review helps

895	shoib.thamleer	Nov 04, 2015	Yes	Its an awesome one	Firstly I wanted to say you will got more than what you paid. Iam used this phone for two weeks. I swear that you will not get this like phone for this price now a days..  Until now I never find a problem  with coolpad and cool ui.  I advise this one if some body ask me to pick one below 7000 price because it worth it.. You can get same quality and better specs than redmi2..  Never wait and don't miss  the chance.  Once sold out I think it won't again be here.  Adv.....  _ most best think I find that is its display.  I give100. _its never waste even a single second of you because it's got a 2gb ram. No slowdowns... Until this 110 marks in 100 _awesome secondary cam.. It's the best that you got in this price. 90 for that.  _battery is not good.. It's perfect. Longed for 1 day with full time use. 100 mark _5 inch display.  Lot more.  Misses...   _protection.. It's not provided with gorilla glass. I think it's necessary for this much sized phone. But I brought one glass protection for 230 _primary camera is not that much good. 70 marks.  Over all I prefer this one if u confused with redmi2 and honor holly

931	srinivasarao n	Oct 31, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

1135	littlestarasad	Oct 22, 2015	Yes	A must buy budget friendly phone you all will love.	Its camera quality..Its screen.. Its Its connectivity.. Its performance.. Its UI.. I want to say that this grand budget device is a must have in 6000/- I mean.. what you expect from a cool budget device? *8/5 mp cameras.with autofocus and flash support.Flash is a plus point. *5" HD 1270*720 pixels (294 ppi) gorilla glass display.viewing angles are great. *4G connectivity.Dual sim, wifi connectivity is great also. *2/16 GB memories.with a 1.2 Ghz 64 bit superfast quad core processor.multitasking makes easier. *2500 mAh all day battery.fast charging.  what I dont like is it comes with android kitkat OS 4.4.4. and from the date of purchasing it doesnt seems to like upgraded to even 5.1 OS till now. but Coolpad is one of the top 10 companies in the world.I think they will not disappoint their customers.because the device is both new and capable to rum on latest android too.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

1215	Charudatt Kumbhare	Oct 19, 2015	Yes	Just one word "OUTSTANDING"	I had used many phones but non was so swift as coolpad dazen 1.  I bought this phone for my mom as a gift from her beloved son and she loved the phone so it's worth fully.   Now every one knows the specifications so I'll only tell u experience from this wacho powerhouse.   The reason for its swiftness is 64bit architecture of its cortex a53 chip. Now in 2015 technology has been cheap enough to have snapdragon 410 SOC under INR 6K. Coz last year these specifications would cost between INR 20k to 27K focusing only on front camera and snapdragon 410 SOC.just look at the hype created by Sony and Samsung and how they  fool Indians.   It's Battery lasts for like 2 days of u just read and take out pictures. On 2G network. While on 3G and 4G networks it will last for whole 12 to 15 hours with 10 % battery remaining.   Camera is very swift just like any person would want. And colours are very accurate. But in day time indoors pictures are not clear then we can use flash. Also the PRO mode is a handy option to play with camera.  It actually automatically detects day and night and indoors and select modes which is amazing. HDR mode is great to use and it's really fast to work on and very joyous experience. Also coming to front camera the auto beauty mode is very helpful it actually removes small blemishes and makes every one look better than real look of a person. Also HDR works great on front came giving real image.everyone are just in love with camera images.  Both camera works fine in night as will and Becklight sensors works good. Pictures with flash on are really quick.   Launcher, people are complaining about launcher can't b changed its not true we can add any launcher. II prefer Nova or Apex launcher which provides all the customisation options.  Just go in settings >apps >all apps >launcher now click remove defaults.  Launch Apex or Nova and select always after pressing home button. Also use moonlight icon pack which has world's best icons.  So be customisation freak and use all power in phone.  Use Apex if ur crazy for customisation or use Nova if ur  moderately freak. Lol.   Call quality is great all sound is clear in all environment.  4G and lower bands can be used as u want,  no problem in that.   Design is good and it actually loka like expensive phone if 25k +INR.  Well its is expensive given the specifications and it could be last year very expensive phone.   Display is mesmerising just u want to look into it and read or watch pictures or movies. Just love the display.   CoolUI is very good and clean.  Handy options.  Torch is handy. All applications run fast and out of 2 gb ram 1.3gb is available.  So we can add more apps and games. Only one drawback is we can't move apps on SD card we have to root it and use aap LINK2SDCARD and we will have all our apps on SD card.  The default music app is Google's so we can't exactly do what we want. So use another.   Use tamper proof glass and back cover for optimal usage and yes it's same as micromax canvas nitro 110 except the processor and 4G and promised user interface.  So at last I can say it's just amazing phone and worth full.   Buy it  Trivia my friend was going to buy Lenovo note k3 but after taking my advice he ordered coolpad dazen 1 yesterday.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Things like Face Lock Multiple Windows for multitasking. Gesture Recognition 2 GB Ram Beautiful UI NO CHEAP LOOK. I bought myself a back cover a graffiti one makes it premium.  i have used phones like  HTC EVO 3D,  IPHONE 4, 5S (boaring iphones nothing much left to do after using them for few months, ridiculously overpriced) ,  BLACKBERRY TORCH 9800, 9900 (days gone for them) HTC 820 DESIRE  lost most of them being careless to be honest  i never felt that happy coz on all above i have spend like big cash. I knew it I am not gonna spend much at the same time I am not gonna compromise in specs and am i not going to pay extra these companies just for there name coz anyways they are not giving me warranty anymore than 1 year and i know the way new phones get launched every week i am obviously gonna get boar within year.  Think wisely  5500RS Only  QUAD CORE/2GB RAM/ Face Lock Multiple Windows for multitasking. Gesture Recognition 8 MP BACK/ 5 MP FRONT CAMERA  AND IT REALLY PERFORMS YOU WILL NOT REGRET COZ NO MATTER FOR HOW LONG I USE IT M GONNA SELL IT FOR ATLEAST 2K IN ANY CONDITION WHAT I LOST 3K EVEN IF I KEEP IT FOR 3 MONTHS   THINK IF ITS GONNA BE HTC/BLACKBERRY/SAMSUNG THEY ARE NOT VALUE FOR MONEY BUT WE KEPT PAYING FOR NAMES. I UNDERSTOOD IT AFTER SPENDING ALMOST 2 LAC ON PHONES WHICH I EVEN DONT HAVE ANYMORE.  THUMBS UP  ITS VALUE FOR EVERY SINGLE PAISA U SPEND ON IT  TRUST ME.

Cons:- 1. average Audio quality. 2. A bit heavy in the pocket. 3. Horrible Service (You will hardly find an active service centres in West Bengal, some imaginary centres are there in COOLPAD Website.) 4. No headphone attached, needs to purchase separately. 5. No Screen Guard provided in the box. 6. No Corning Gorilla Glass. 7. No Manual provided in the box so difficult to understand for new users. 8. Only one Flip cover is available that is also with SNAPDEAL, not in the open market. 9. Expensive flip cover with bad quality in snapdeal. 10. Old software version.  Still then I can suggest that this phone can be purchased and used.

It has 4g / 3g / 2g network on 1st sim and we can't select only 3g network. In NCR it's working good but in villages where network problem is going on It supports only 2g and sometimes 3g.  Overall experience is very good.  Thanks to Coolpad for making a nice phone.

1826	viru	Sep 30, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

2097	kankan	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	Coolpad dazen1	Awesome phone in this price range This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

2147	Abhijeet	Sep 21, 2015	Yes	Best product..!!	I recently purchased coolpad Dazen 1.  Using since a week.  Very good phone. Observation as follows  Design While the Coolpad Dazen 1 is decent to look at, we found the design of the phone to be very ordinary. There's no real novelty and it looks like any other budget Android smartphone available in the market.  Dazen 1 has a 5-inch screen with thick bezels, and is light to hold at 155g. The smartphone's power button is on the right edge whereas the volume rocker button is on the left edge. The 3.5mm headphone jack is located at the top of the phone and the microUSB port is at the bottom.    The removable back panel sports a matte finish, which looks good and makes the phone easy to grip. The back also features a camera lens at the top along with LED flash, and there's some Dazen branding below it. The speaker outlet is at the bottom with Coolpad branding above it. On removing the back panel, you'll be able to see the stacked dual-sim card slot, the microSD card slot, and the removable battery of the phone.  The smartphone's front panel has three capacitive touchscreen buttons that are backlit. Overall, Dazen 1 looks like any other budget smartphone with a 5-inch display and doesn't really have a differentiating trait.  Display The Dazen 1 features a 5.0-inch (1280x720p) capacitive touchscreen display, which we found to be impressive.  The display was bright and colours looked rich and vibrant on it. The viewing angles were also pretty good and colours did not distort even when we did not look at the phone head-on. There were no problems in using the phone under direct sunlight.    Although, we did not observe any pixilation, the display was very prone to smudging, and was more or less a fingerprint magnet. Apart from this, we don't have any complaints with the display of the smartphone.  Software The Dazen 1 smartphone comes with Android 4.4 KitKat skinned with the company's own Cool UI.  The phone's UI has no app drawer, and all the app icons are displayed on the phone's homescreen. The phone comes preloaded with a number of apps including WeChat, WPS Office, Facebook, SwiftKey, among others. Some of these preloaded apps were specifically designed for Coolpad including Lock Screen, CoolShow, Rock Wallpaper, and Cool store.  The Rock Wallpaper app is one of the most interesting apps in the phone, on touching it, it automatically changes the wallpaper of your smartphone. And till the time we used the phone, not a single wallpaper was repeated.    Apart from this, a widget called CoolShow lets users switch themes, wallpapers, lockscreen wallpapers, alarm tones, notification tones, etc. Long pressing the home screen gives users the option of changing settings of widgets, wallpapers, effects, and preferences. The user can use these to hide or sort out apps, activate screen switchover, arrange icons, etc.  Users can also access two different apps at the same time by using split screen option. To sum it up, we like the software experience the smartphone offered and did not face any issues with it.  Performance Powered by a 1.2 GHz Quad-Core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (MSM8916) processor with Adreno 306 GPU, the Dazen 1 is a decent performer. The smartphone also has 8GB of internal storage out which around 3GB is available to the users. But people who want to store more can install microSD cards of up to 32GB.

Pics some time come blurred. Pixels fade if we  zoom pic.  2)Restart  automatically. In my case it happens 2-3 times already.   Overall my verdict is that in this price this 4G smartphone  is worth to buy.

2414	Pavan	Sep 11, 2015	Yes	superb phone	I. Have been using the Coolpad Dazen1 for the last 6 days and the device just blows me away.   Design: it's light and comfortable to hold. The touch on the back looks feels very soft and has the feel of old thinkpad laptops  Display: The killer feature of this phone is the Full HD IPS display. It's a treat to watch movies, text and images on this phone. There's so much detail that's visible over my 720p screen. Also the viewing angles are excellent - thanks to the IPS screen. THe brightness and sunlight visiblity is quite remarkable. You can buy the phone for the awesome display alone.  Touch: The touch sensitivity feels so smooth on this phone. I've used 4 android phones before and also have an ipad 2. But the touch on this phone feels better than all my previous devices. You just feel like scrolling through the pages - it's so much fun   Camera:  The intial test looks very good. It has very good color reproduction, the white balance is accurate and the normal images have a higher dynamic range. Overall in this price segment, this camera seems to offer a lot of value.   CPU: the real life performance also seemed pretty awesome - I came to the conclusion that the awesome touch sensitivity might be a function of this super CPU with 2GB RAM   The battery seem to be good and it easily lasted over 1 day for average to heavy use. It comes with an expandable slot unlike Mi 4i - hence you don't have to worry about storage. You get upto 40GB of storage - 8GB + 32GB Expanable.   Overall, the device truly is a killer. This is truly a disruptive phone and thanks to Coolpad for bringing it to India. Thanks Snapdeal for the prompt service. Enjoying this device and become a big fan of Coolpad Dazen1

2470	veer	Sep 09, 2015	Yes	very good product	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

2702	Wasim	Sep 02, 2015	Yes	Very Good Phone with A Very Good Camera (Till Now)	Bought the product in July. To my bad luck, I go a defective one which used to restart in every 20-30 mins. Contacted the customer care within 2 days. As instructed by the Customer Care I factory reset the phone several times, gave full charge etc. with no result. Also went to the Service Centre as instructed by the CC (they were supposed the change a defective set, if objected within 7days of purchase. Right.!!)  & the SC misled me further saying they have just got the license to operate as DAZEN Service Centre & have got nothing; no expertise, no software etc. & told me to come back after a week. Dejected I came back and e-mailed Snapdeal Customer Care. I really don't know what happened after that mail (Previously I sent several mails & made calls, but got misleading instructions/response from the SD CC), I received calls from SD CC again but with surprising response. The were so eager to change the handset this time & were sorry for the inconvenience it caused to me. I thank them for that. I also received lots smss, mails after that last e-mail from SD CC informing me the process to replace the handset etc. which literally overwhelmed me. Thank god, I got the replaced handset within 3 days which was very quick in my view, given Snapdeal's earlier delivery record (I had to cancel an earlier order with SD, as they were more than 20days late in delivering). As it said all is  well that ends well.  Now about the handset. Its very good looking & very well built given the price. Buttons give good tactile feedback & the phone looks way better than its price. Its a benchmark in this category I would say. Very good hardware response (I'm not going to discuss the specs as its already in the SD website). No lag till now. Very good and vibrant color representation from the 5" big hd screen. The most special thing about the handset is its camera. From 5 mp cam is marvel, presents very good & detailed pic. Back 8 mp is also amazing, producing detailed & color rich pictures. Overall its an unbelievable package at this price point & can put its closer price rivals (Like Nokia Lumia 535.!!) in shame. Only thing is, I have to watch how the phone performs in long run as its only 2mnths old. I would recommend this phone blindfoldedly depending on its performance till now. Its a steal at this price point & undisputed leader. Four Star for the initial glitch.  CC- Customer Care SD- SnapDeal SC- Service Centre

2826	AvadeshYadav	Aug 30, 2015	Yes	Average phone nothing awesome	Good battery backup, Okay camera quality for outdoor but not that much good for indoor clicks so overall not as good as shown in specs as 5 stack lens. Available RAM showing 1.2GB but when you delete a file or open file browser it is taking a bit time so not looking like 2GB RAM mobile working like 512MB RAM mobile. Played Temple run game and it was smooth. Touch is also good. One bad thing is there are lots of preinstalled apps and you cannot remove those if you don't need them. They have given a lot of wallpapers in internal storage, but here the good thing is you can delete them if you don't need them. The sound is little bit low for ringtones and also for music. The FM don't work in my piece, the FM app crashes if I try to swipe for change frequency. Display quality is average. I didn't check 4g as I don't have a 4g sim, 3g worked well. Also tested WiFi, Bluetooth both worked well. Their customized os is also a bit slower than clean android given on moto g/e.  So overall performance of this phone is average not matching with hardware specs.
2827	Nawabzada Z	Aug 30, 2015	Yes	Its gud	Awesome camera.. gud processor. All gud bt there is something wrong wid its battery while showing  percentage % the battery icon starts  flipping. .so its betr to keep battery % off..overall its worth money

2943	skamalamani	Aug 24, 2015	Yes	Very good phone with certain drawbacks	4G is working very well. Both rear and front cameras are taking excellent photos and videos. Main draw back is all the apps and photos are stored in phone memory. There is provision for micro SD card but there is no instruction how to load or transfer apps and photos from phone to SD card. So micro SD card remains blank while the phone memory is fully occupied. Some clear instruction should be given in the manual. Otherwise phone is very good in all respect

2949	Rahul 009	Aug 24, 2015	Yes	Good phone but little heating issues	I got this phone today and after using it for few hours here is some important things you might want to know before purchasing this phone  1. Everyone is saying that this phone doesn't have issues of heating but when i played games(Need for speed most wanted and Asphalt 8) phone started heating around camera, this doesn't heat a lot but eventually it does get hot.   2.Camera quality is good but flash is not satisfactory   3.Very handy design   4.Crisp crystal clear screen , same like redmi 2. You won't notice any change even after redmi 2 has more ppi   5. Perfect viewing angle  6.Used internet for approx three hours and battery drained only 20%,doesn't it is great ?  7.I don't know why but at first while video recording, camera was not focusing properly everything was blured but after first attempt camera did its job and video recording quality is good   8. there are two modes for camera shots Pro and Normal , obviously i am able to click better shots in Pro mode, camera clicks shots really fast  9. It doesn't have fast charge but you won't feel as this needs phone needs fast charge because it charges fast  10. Snapdragon Qualcomm 1.2 GHz with 2 GB RAM will make work all your jobs done without any problem

3058	KrIZILLoX	Aug 13, 2015	Yes	Bought this phone a week ago	Im in great love with this cool phone :D  talking about the phone,  it is a chinese phone. What ??  WHATTTT WHHHHHAAAAAATTTTTTTTT ???    nothing to worry guys,  yes it is a chinese phone but that doesnt mean it has a low quality.  i am writing this review with the same phone.  it is a really cool phone.  its UI is awesome,  its even faster than other branded phones.  it equipped with 2GB RAM and it makes the processes go really fast :D   i use heavy music production apps on this phone,  when i ran them on SAMSUNG NOTE 3 it hanged a lot.  sometimes the note 3 would shut down but this coolpad dazen 1 does the job with a great ease. and this is no joke folks.    it has a 1.2 GHz quad core processor and it is doing its job awesomely,  no glitches,  no heating,  no battery faults,  an awesome backup of in screen 3 hours AM TALKING ABOUT ON SCREEN BACKUP NOT STANDBY BACKUP :/ PAY ATTENTION.   this phone is pretty cool with its design and its looks can easily make you fall in love for it.   A GREAT THING IN THIS PHONE THAT REALLY IMPRESSED ME is  its resolution.  its high resolution makes the gameplay look so sooooo cool that i just cant describe in words.  it is really awesome with games like Asphalt and Modern Combat 5. love this phone.   this is a true and honest review about this phone.  i am a daily user of this phone and i charge it once a day and right now its battery percentage is 27%. i charge it at night.  its really awesome guys,  a great buy.  and its battery is a 2500 mAh battery.    but ITS A CHINESE PHONE :o   HELL YEA ITS A chinese phone but it is a really awesome phone too.   you can buy it with great confidence guys.  this phone wont put down your expectations.    i love this phone and i know,  if you buy this,  you will love it too ^_^  happy shopping :)

Not only did I purchased 2 phone's, I referred it to 2 friends and they also had a very positive review after purchasing it.  The delivery time was amazing, a turnaround of 1 day. Kudos to the snapdeal team and the seller.  The only thing that should be considered is bundling an ear phone with the phone, the absence of which I'd little awkward to me. In addition if you are looking to buy a tempered glass or cover for this phone, you can actually buy the one available for micromax a310/311 which is more easily available and cheaper to buy and fits perfectly.

Apart from these, all seems to be ok and I am very satisfied with the product!

I was bit unsatisfied when i see at the first time.. because It made me to feel when i use it that i have got a clear china product in my hand. but later i realized that it's worth more than what i spent for it.. If you were not using smartphones earlier.. you can really go for it. there is no doubt..it will give you good experience.. If you already used smartphones.. I don't need to tell you .. you know better than me..   ++++++++  Gaming - Supports well..  Display  - Better Performance (Supports all Videos) Camera - Good Performance . Both Cameras are Good..(Specifically in the Day Light) Battery  - Good (It will come for a Whole Day..) Product - Slimmer and Good looking..  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Audio is not much Sounded  Calling options are not as User friendly Power on Button is very small (could be little more bigger in size) not sure about upgrading to lollipop not supporting some themes that i have downloaded from Play store..  Conclusion :               I have recommended to buy this phone.

However found the workaround by installing super backup App.   Here is what to do to install an app to sd card- 1.  Install super backup App 2.  After installing super backup app install any app which you want to install to sd card. First it will install to internal space but super back will take its backup in sd card automatically while installing. 3. uninstall the app and then reinstall it again. Now this time it will automatically install to sd card.

I have purchased & have been using Lenovo A6000 & Plus, Redmi S2, Yu Phoria for couples of days each which I ordered for my cousins & sisters.   Coolpad beats all of them in every aspects. Nothing much to say! Coolpad Dazen 1 is the obvious winner.

3276	Sudhakar Reddy MR	Jul 28, 2015	Yes	Coolpad Dazen 1 a true budget lovers phone	Coolpad Dazen1: I bought this phone after so much of research on various phones including Redmi2, MotoE2, Honor Holly, Yuphoria, Lenovo A6000 Plus and InFocus M2. but at 6000 you cant get more. This review is written after using the phonefor a week. Below are my finding  pros  - Display is really good with HD and also better protected with Corning Gorilla glass. - 2 Gb Ram gives the phone an added ammo for smooth multitasking without any lag. - Sound quality is Good given the price range. - UI is fairly easy, though would have loved stock. - Battery backup is Great lasts more than a day. - Though phone may not look best its sturdy and of good build quality.  cons No head phones Lack of Service centres though not tried.

3290	Hasif	Jul 27, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

A worthy competitor to Redmi 2 and way better than Moto e 2nd Gen.  Please watch our video review for in-depth analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqTAiYtzBOA

Pros: Good clear screen Decent battey backup UI and phone itself is very responsive Did not experience any lag thanks to Quad core processor and 2 GB of RAM in it Feels good to hold and use Good and fast camera for its price  Cons: Not much cons for the price range really. Would have appreciated if it had some screen protection like gorilla glass or dragon tail glass. Already knew no headphones, screen guard or cover etc. Its better to buy a good quality one later than get a cheap one in the box and complain about it.  Result: Very happy with the phone and will recommend to others as well. Since this is the first Coolpad product I have owned, durability is still a question for me. However time will tell...

3425	3426	Harsh	Jul 13, 2015	Yes	Good but bot the best option at 6000 Rs	Coolpad affordable series has definitely come a long way and with its current Dazen 1. The company is really going to great lengths to deliver abundant functionality and usability at a modest price tag.  Key features 5" 16M-color 720x1280 IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen Android OS v4.4.4 KitKat with CoolUI Quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A53; Snapdragon 410, Adreno 306, 2GB RAM 8MP camera with 1080p@30fps video; 2MP front-facing camera with 720p video 8GB of built-in storage and a microSD card slot LTE connectivity with optional Dual SIM support Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, GPS receiver, Bluetooth v4.1, FM radio Active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic 2,300mAh removable battery  Main disadvantages:  Average cameras Poor RAM Management  Battery Hogger No Lollipop OS/Updates  The Dazen 1 doesn't give off the impression that it was created to broaden choice in the budget market segment.

3439	vineet	Jul 12, 2015	Yes	The best available phone at this price!	Before buying this one, I read in the reviews on snapdeal that it is a masterpiece. I must say, it is indeed!  This phone has excellent features like: -Installing apps to sd card directly. -Camera  are excellent, both front and back. -Battery backup is nice -I tried playing asphalt 7, worked fine -Crisp display -Only phone which offers 2GB RAM at this price  Only issue I found was that the accessories like back cover and screen guard were not available from the outside market, and the prices online were high..But, again, who cares if such a thing is available at this price.  Been using it for 3 days, no heating issue, everything looks fine..I'll update if i find any problem...So far, I'm loving it!

3441	jamil	Jul 12, 2015	Yes	the supar mobile	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

3456	Dlan	Jul 11, 2015	Yes	Awesome if you compare price and competitor	1. Design - 9 2. Battery - 9 3. Camera - 9 4. Display - 8 5. Touch - 7 (not very smooth) 6. Look - 9 (rich) 5. Weight - 8   After 4 days use, it's a very good phone which has rich look and completely satisfied with the purchase. But my only concern is service which is not bothering as long as I mishandle it :P Now a days phone becomes use and throw / exchange (only if model is less than a year old, otherwise it'll be expired mostly android phones....) becoz of service cost.

3465	Arun	Jul 11, 2015	Yes	Nice product - UI is good - but no gorilla glass protection	Good budget phone but due to lack of gorilla glass protection you need to handle the mobile very carefully.  Also they didn't mention about servicing centres. I don't found service centres list anywhere. Navigation always lists Chinese areas.. No upgrade found for lollipop. Happy to have all high-end features in low budget but a Chinese phone is always Chinese phone.

3479	Vikash	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	really a work horse	this is the best phone ,as far as price constraint coupled with business feature, in the market.By going through its feature i realise that phone is exceptionally well in some areas,like connectivity,multitasking with apps as well as working with my documents,nevertheless the phone has foregone  traditional feature of supporting FM recording and it also does not scan all the stations available in a particular area-i have checked it specifically in kolkata with it and Panasonic P55 as well.Heating problem is also almost not.  LED  flash while taking photo ,as mentioned ,is also not coming .
3480	Avadh	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Good phone at this price, you won't regret	Good phone at this price, you won't regret Hello Folks, I compared this with ASUS ZenFone (2 GB RAM) and Moto G (1st Gen) and also with Moto E (1st Gen), this phone stands tall and stays no. 1 in terms of:   Camera quality (Pics and Videos are very fine with decent audio quality) Display Quality (Very Crisp and Vivid) Sound Quality is very loud even on single speaker, I did not try out in headset or earphone. Have 4G LTE,  Call quality is very good  Front Camera is awesome for Selfies and Skype. Battery Life seems to good as I used only for one day, it will last for more than a day for moderate use, like 1-2 hrs of calls, 1-2 hrs of internet surfing, 2-3 hrs of Whatsapp and FB. Its a decent phone with customized Android,   Its a complete package for basic phone users within 7k, it has almost all the sensors and features that you need in a smartphone. You can go for it :-)
3481	venu	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone and good features......	Wow.. best phone. If your budget is low then buy this phone with excellent features...... Wow.. best phone. If your budget is low then buy this phone with excellent features....

3485	Thangaraj	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	A good secondary phone!	The phone was well built, the cameras are okay, not very crisp.  The quality of the phone vs the price is amazing, it has 2 gb ram and snapdragon processor, in this price category I dont think no other phone is available in the market.  I writing this review after 15 days using this mobile, the display is crisp and clear, the auto brightness mode for display is not upto the mark as high end phones do, very responsive touch screen.  Never hangs or lags, no issues found by me while using this phone. UI need to improve looks very plain.  Battery is well enough for a single day use! really it is plus to this phone and charger build quality is very well, no heating issues, hd videos run smoothly.  For this price it is a wonderful package. If you already own a flagship phone, and looking for a camera phone for siblings you can surly go for this product.
3486	N PRADEEP	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Best phone for middle class - who have a dream to use SMARTPHONE	This phone is good in processing speed, pixel resolution, HD Camera is also a remarkable feature to support. This is my dream device ever used. Thank You for this offer!!!!

3494	John.	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Good Cell phone according to my experience	I purchased it in lowest price & it works properly. I satisfied with this product. but there is one bad point. coolpad does not give the earphone with cell.
3495	SG.	Jul 09, 2015	Yes	Worth every penny!	Firstly, I ordered this for my mum at about 11 p.m. and it had already been dispatched by 12 a.m. so Snapdeal shipped it in record time. Received the phone in immaculate condition and everything seemed to work fine *except* the front-facing camera which showed a few lines on screen in low-light areas. Of course the phone could be replaced but for someone who barely clicks pictures of themselves, this wasn't an issue.   This phone could very well be on par with the Nexus 5 I'm currently using. The battery is removable which is a plus, and two SIM card slots (one with 4G support) is more than one could ask for. The plastic back cover is little flimsy for my liking but the phone is sleek overall and matches up to the specs as advertised. Basically, this phone is a bargain for what you get and I'll have to vouch for it along with the thousands of others who've given this excellent reviews.  On a sidenote, Snapdeal has the exchange scheme going so I basically got back half of what I paid for this phone in exchange for my old phone, so I'm more than happy with this transaction.
3496	Vijay	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	High performance mobile	Best price with the features it has. Awesome with 2 gb ram and 64 bit snapdragon processor. Good service by snapdeal. Delivery on time with good packing. Value for money
3497	pmahadik@34	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Don't ask more	great phone with number of features good thing is the battery backup cam is much better than other brand in same price.
3498	RAMS	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Coolpad Dozen 1	got the product on second day.. Supports 3G...Some heating issues but not too much..good display... camera quality is ok.. Not faced any call drop issues...not tried on games...but the processing of images and mails are faster... not supports exchange server mails directly...need to download mail service from google play for exchange server ( outlook mails).. Battery life is good... with average use one full day...the touch feel is good.. the biggest draw back is that we can cot move the applications to SD card..Good value for money..This based on my usage for 4 days...Since the product is newly launched we need to use more for the durable performance..good service by snap deal.. I would recommend the product if you have budget constraints..

3506	Ravi	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Just go for it! This one is better than many others INR 10K+ range Smartphones in INR 6K Price.	While buying this, I was a little hesitant, thinking, whether to go with a branded one or a new product, for which not many reviews were available. but thought of giving it a try after looking at the specifications. Believe me, its worth every penny. it works exactly the same way, as any other 10-12 K  smartphone works. I have a MI4I also at home, but this one is no less than that, and speed is just too good. Clarity of screen is also perfect. in one word, Go for it! you will not repent.
3507	Zubair666	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Great phone but if you could extra go for YU ot lenovo.	Pros. 1. Same configuration of yuphoria and lenovo a6000 plus. 2. Good price and good quality. 3. Good speakers. 4. Excellent battery life. 5. Not heating like yu or lenovo. 6. More service centers.   Cons. 1. UI is a bit laggy compared to CM in yuphoria but has many features ( same as lenovo Vibe UI). 2. Touch and camera is good but not excellent. 3. Weak UI (OTA) support compared to CM and MIUI. 4. UPDATE are recommend for smooth usage.

3513	Aditya	Jul 08, 2015	Yes	Good Phone to Purchased	I purchased the phone in June 2015, The look and feel of the phone is good. Camera is also good. Despite of 2GB ram sometimes the games stops unexpectedly. Overall good to buy.

3518	Vikrant	Jul 07, 2015	Yes	Some major disadvantages too !!	Screen resolution poor as my earlier photos from my old sd card are very unclear / hazy in this handset and which were absolutely clear on my old micromax android one. Also the camera not at all gives the impact of 8mp front and 5mp back rear camera resolution at all. Also there is no equaliser to enhance the volume  in the inbuilt default player , Audio volume is low and crispness in sound is missing. Headphones should have been definitely accompanied with it with minimal cost escalation.
3519	BALAFAZER	Jul 07, 2015	Yes	Super mobile for this cost.	=>    good speed,Good battery, Good touch response, Good look, Good body metal.   =>   still now its awesome, but i don't know about Mobile service center.

3526	Benson	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	Good phone. Great Hardware. Small glitches in Software.	The phone is very good. For this price range, there is nothing more I can expect. The hardware is excellent, the specifications are great. On the software side however, there are some bugs, which I would like to point. These are what I've experienced. It may differ for others: 1. I cannot see some contacts which I just added to the phonebook. When I type the number in dialer, the contact appears with the name. But when I type the name, it says no results. The contacts app is a pain to use. 2. There is no default conversation view for SMS. It's the old Inbox, outbox, sent lists. Inside a message you've to select 'view thread' to see the conversation temporarily. 3. 3G network keeps changing to 2G in most places. When I manually select network and choose 3G it comes up, but after sometime it changes back to 2G and net speed drops. This could be with the area also. But Im right in the heart of Bangalore city. 4. Default app installation is in the phone memory. Even when I choose 'default storage' for apps as memory card, all the apps are still installed on the phone memory. Only pictures and other media are going to the SD card. With 8GB of ROM, I'm in for trouble very soon!  Overall, the phone is good to use, with no major complaints. So giving 4 stars. Well done!
3527	dhruv	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	updated review from 1star to 5star	Intially wen i switch on the phone for the 1st time i found it little bit hot. But later i came to know that it is due to low battery and its heating area concentrated only in the upper part. After fully charged it, it is working completely fine withut creating issue so far. I think for me it is a must have product who is looking for budget smartphone.
3528	Aarif	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	Perfect....	Every thing is very good at this price range....................................................................................................................
3529	DP	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	Coolpad Dazen 1	Best mobile in this price. Too good. Nice camera , nice speed, only earphones were required with this.

3532	AK	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	Product is good but there is no exchange ActiveSync	Dear All,  product is very good however there is no exchange activesync to configure exchange server mailbox in this phone. you may use POP &MAPI; for the same.  Thanks AK
3533	saprasath	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	phone is good	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

3536	Ron	Jul 06, 2015	Yes	Decent phone under 6K	I don't think there is any better smartphone available in the market  under 6K.The phone has decent features... 2 gigs of ram and a 2500mAh battery makes it stand out  from the other smartphones within the same price segment.Though the phone is a little bulky,the 5" device feels comfortable on hands.The back side is however a little slippery.I have used this phone for 2 weeks now and all is good upto this point...no hangs.All in all it is a good smartphone. I have summarized the pros and cons below: Pros: Clear display, good battery backup, ok camera, no lags. Cons: No corning gorilla,a little bulky,back is slippery

Touch is smooth, UI is lag free, camera is decent, flash is powerfull, selfie 5MP Camera does a good job, screen quality is great, build quality is excellent, notification LED light have multiple colors, capacitive keys do light up, apps can be insatll/move to SD Card. Some cons are NO USB OTG support, difficult to find relevant accessories, not much development, no info about the Lollipop update.
3558	dabbu	Jul 05, 2015	Yes	Perfect Budget Phone	I have been using this phone for few days and I will fully satisfied with the phone.  The phone perfectly fit in my hand and the build quality is superb. ------------------- Pros: ------------------- # Super build Quality. Phone is slim and Screen/Body ratio is great. And the black color is really awesome. # The call quality is also good # Unlike other budget phone the camera is great and the company has not compromised too much in this area # The touch is quite responsive  # BATTERY backup is best I have seen in smartphone. The last best was my Lumia 730 and it will give a tough competition to that phone. The battery backup can be only reason for many customers to go for this phone.  # The screen quality is good and I didn't find any issue here. # The phone charges from 4% to 100% within 2 hours which is another good thing when compared to other phones with 2500mAh battery. ----------------------- Cons ----------------------- # The lock button need extra push to work (may be the issue is with my phone only) # The touch don't get recorded sometimes (again not a big issue) # Less number of accessories are available in market (screen guard and cover only)

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands
3636	Narasimha	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	Simply superb	No words to say about this mobile simply superb with its features
3637	deep	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	best budget phone till now.	Coolpad dazen best in under its range.good camera, good battery backup,I really apperitiate company that they opened service centre before product launch.other compititor like yuphoria has not single service centre in india.and xiomi service centre provide only in metro cities.dazen best budget mobile under 6000. Cons-not any.
3638	Logesh Raj	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	Low budget ..And looking for pone with great featuresGOFORIT	I got this product with 4 days from ordering . Good delivery by Snapdeal.  This is a good phone this budget maybe 2GB Ram impress you but camera is not good . There is no 3g in First Sim .Only 2G. One of the main problem in this phone Sim Slot 1 shows second Sim when inserted and Slot 2 shows First Sim .That's one of the main drawback. Touch is good . Sensors are good . Speakers are excellent that is sound quality. Good Finishing . But User Interface which matters a lot ...here it is MI's UI. MI is already a copy of IPhone UI ..here they have copied MI UI . But games weren't lagging. At times heating occurs. Not Like in lenova A600 . Front Camera is perfect to take a selfie.4g is not at all working . I'm using airtel Sim oony don't know what's the problem behind it. Attimes 3g comes and vanishes . So 2G is Standard in this phone. Finally,This phone is worth for money as it is in very low prize .Same Features given by Samsung or HTC costs more than 15 or 20k.Go for it if u look for low budget.
3639	Teju	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	I recommend to friend if you want a android phone buy this	Nice feature phone in this range 2gb ram make it powerfull nice product in 6000 camera is also good front camera is also good touch is good littlebit battary issue but every android is same issue.

Screen swiping is smooth No lagging so far ( 15 days usage)  CONS  When i called and checked the service centers in chennai. They asked me What is mean by Coolpad. Very strange.. Not sure if coolpad will be famous soon and accessories will be available.
3660	bhavesh	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	Good Phone In Low Budget Segment But not Much Awesome	Hi Review after 7 days...Usage 1)  Awesome Phone Crisp display...  2 ) Good Ram Management as Compare to Xiaomi 2Gb Ram Model... 3 ) No Heating light but ignorable... 4 )  Defiantly for high end gaming...  5 ) Cool Ui  same as Xiaomi Miui Product... little  bit.. difference.. 6 ) Apps transferable to SD Card .. 7 ) Battery Backup Good..  8 ) Camera Quality is Ok not much Good says Average... 9 ) No Otg Support

3664	ashu	Jul 04, 2015	Yes	Phone is good but lacks software	The phones is good. But it has some flaws too. Biggest drawback is headphones audio is just ok coz there is no equalizer in cool ui. Rest all things are fine be it camera or display or battery backup. One more thing, you won't be able to see your notification coz most of the notifications are shown in other tab, which is annoying and you will see only other on display. The best part of this phone is battery backup, it gives you good backup even on 3g too. I mailed coolpad regarding release of source codes and factory images, so that I can do some development and port some other roms for dazen 1 but unfortunately they never replied back. Phone is good in hardware but lacks software part.

3681	Sunil Sharma	Jul 03, 2015	Yes	Awesome Phone	This is is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands
3682	Shubham Singh	Jul 03, 2015	Yes	Best Smartphone in the Best Price with The Best  Features	okay,  without let's start my first review... it's my first andriod mobile and believe me guys i wasted my 15 days in searching for a best  phone under 7K and Yes.. i found it.. Pros -   Performance - i m using it for 10 days.. and it proved itself.  i installed 24 apps ans some more games and the phone is still working smoothly.    Battery Backup - the battery backup is great.  while using the mobile normally (whatsapp, facebook chatting)  it gives an average battery backup of 600 minuts.. means 1% = 6 minute.   Personalization -  the "CoolUI"  gives us the power to personalize the phone in every possible.  options like traditional style and minimize style makes the Menu impressive and gives us the ability to use phone as we like.   Camara -  i just want to say about camara, is "Excellent. " The 8mp camara takes pictures in detailed quality. Zoom the pictures and they are still clear.  5 MP camara is a great choice for selfie lovers.  they will juat love it.  "Beautify"  makes selfies beautiful than ever..!!!   Display & Design -  The 5" display is great option for those who want to experience a bigger display.  I can watch almost every type of movie in 720P with its default Video player.  touch is smooth and design is slim and attractive.    Cons -  No earphones included, low speaker sound (average).   if your budget is low then go for it. but if you want to buy a quality product then this may not the brand you are seeking for. anyway, any brand needs caring. if you love features and dont care in which brand has the best features then go for coolpad dazen1.. best of luck guys..!!!

Doesn't find too many features, need to install some extra s/w like Data counter, Music app (Just have Google music in it), Weather app. Camera is good in this range phone.  Pros - Good Hardware, Premium Finish, Good battery backup, Good performance.  Cons - Speakers, No Headphones, Software part, Camera.  Overall - Yes, I found this phone great, just waiting for lollipop upgrade.

3739	Saurabh	Jul 03, 2015	Yes	"Best phone in the 5000-7000 segment"	TL;DR : This phone is great for a person who seeks out a phone which is the ideal size to operate with one hand, has a great battery life, simple but sophisticated body design, can handle daily tasks and has a good camera.  DESIGN: Feels good and sturdy. The touch screen can be operated with a single hand. The soft matte back cover gives a good grip and doesn't reflect light like cheap plastic back covers of other phones. The front black glass also looks great while the screen is off. Overall, the phone design looks sophisticated.  DISPLAY: It is a good thing to not have full HD resolution as it serves no significant purpose and would have only consumed more battery power. The display resolution is crisp and sharp on the 5" screen. Touch feedback is great and has not lagged in my 1 week of use. Colors are rich and vibrant.  BATTERY: This is the best part of the phone. On many occasions, I have used WhatsApp for stretches of 4-5 hours, closing the app inbetween to explore the phone and opening the app back up to read and reply to messages. This usage only cost me 10% of the battery. I was using a 2G connection. I have been moderately using the phone, and it lasts me a good 1.5 days. Light users can easily take it up till 2 or maybe even 2.5 days.  Camera: The camera quality is neither bad but neither something too great. Color reproduction is really good and the shutter lag is minimal. The photos look really great on a 5" and 6" phone screen, and also good on a 14" laptop screen. However, zooming in the image will not impress you. Focussing on objects was not an issue. In a nutshell, if you are not concerned about fine details, the images look really good on mobile screens.  UI: The UI is clean and sleek and highly customizable.  Performance: The phone has been handling multiple apps without any lag at all. Every app has been running smoothly. I cannot talk much about gaming but I am guessing it is similar to redmi 2, yuphoria and a6000 plus due to the same CPU and GPU.

I am very pleased and happy, as i have been trying to find a right phone for my needs, and coolpad fits the bill. my previous three purchases with snapdeal have also been good buy's, Camera clarity is unbeatable compared to other phones which claim more than or equal mp to coolpad's.  overall after 2 weeks of usage, i claim that the cool pad dazen 1 has definetely kindled ' feel good factor' inside me.  though i missed the headset initially, i have no regrets as coolpad specs and performance is insatiable.  Note-I know what i am talking about, as i have been using android phones for the last 5 years and This is a sincere comment in appreciation of a true package worthy of its price.

3946	I mridul	Jul 01, 2015	Yes	Don't judge a book by its cover	Finally the bigger brands of smartphones are in trouble. If you will get the desired specs in far less price, why will you burn a hole into your pocket.  Good about :touch is very much impressive. Even you have a glove mode. Feels like a 15k or more of.  Display is superb being a HD ips screen.  Camera is the leader of the device here. You will get awesome pics from both front and rear camera.  2 gb Ram will get you a powerful device in your hand and that too icing on cake will be with qualcomm processor  No any lags or waiting in the device.  Battery life is satisfactory in the range.   Bad About :no earphones provided and the rest is that it is not any hefty price brand.   Overall :if you aren't in habit of trying only the expensive and big brands then just grab this device. You will not be disappointed any more.

I bought COOLPAD DAZEN 1 after looking at it price range & to be honest with u all. I am very much satisfied with this purchase, I am using this handset since a past week now and its better then my last 2 smart phone purchases i.e LENOVO A6000 & HONOR 4X.  I dont comment more on technical point as i myself is not familiar with it, But i will certainly tell u those poits which i look for before making any smart phone purchases.  1. Screen quality is very good, No lags in touch. 2. Output sound quality is awesome, Not with default ringtones but with other music files. 3. Pictures comes better then my HONOR 4X. 4. Battery life is very good (Note i am always on wifi, I had not used data pack in any of my past smart phone also, So i dont know how battery perform in data pack is on, I use wifi 9-10 hours a day.  At the end i can only say that at this price range dont think of any other phone. Its really a good buy. Rest is your decision.

4149	HASHIM	Jun 29, 2015	Yes	Awesome VFM Phone -  Killer mobile in this category	This is my 4th phone in 6 weeks time.. Earlier I have purchased Redme 2, Lenovo A6000, A6000 plus, moto G2.. This one beats all these phone by all aspects..   Pros: Long lasting battery - I am a power user,  none of the phone last more than 15hrs for my level of usage,  but Dazen1 does  Crispy and brighter display with very good ambient light sensor modulation.. Easy to use in bright sunny conditions as well..   Camera is awesome in outdoor bright light conditions but indoor pics needs improvement,  selfies are Ok  Sound is loud enough and clear  Performance is very good without any lag and delay with any apps or games..   Cons Slightly gets heated up while charging but that's quite normal with all other phones as well now a days  You may have to purchase a back cover or flip cover as thus phone is very slippery in hand   Final Verdict  For the amount you spend it worth each penny..  Awesome phone..  I recommend this for all you would like to buy it.. Go for it

Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp, Battery backup is awesome, speaker is good, installed apps are of great use, not too light or too heavy. Cons: None in my opinion. Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands. By Abhilash Dutta, Bordubi

This is not useful if one has to tether phone to use on 3g networks where the 3g network is of less signal strength. In redmi 1s there was option to change this mode. else this does not heat up and is good phone.

4702	Nadeem Anwar Usmani	Jun 17, 2015	Yes	Scintillating as well as mesmerizing coolpad dazen 1	Currently there is no issue or problem with this phone except hanging for a while during Internet surfing while connecting it through the WiFi. Front camera is fabulous you might be loving it by seeing it battery is also acceptable and reasonable but still I am not very much convinced or satisfied with the presence of 2 GB RAM and 64 bit processor, it should work a bit faster as such specifications are so good as written. By the way I am still using it it's only seven days old, plenty of things to check and examined. Finally if someone has limited range of price budget definitely he can go for this beautiful and attractive phone...

4704	Khan	Jun 17, 2015	Yes	Coolpad dazen one  phone review	This phone is awasome. Display is very good and rich  Camera was very clear Battry backup is excillent. 4g support.  But the body was  This phone is very weak and very heavy
4705	dpsisi	Jun 17, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	I bought one Coolpad Dazen 1 through their special lauch program in snapdeal. I generally have good faith in such market launch of smartphones. As it turns out I am not wrong. I am using it for few days now and there are two aspects most impressive. The first one is batter life, which is really amazing. The other one is the minimally sufficient programs within their bootloader. It is not one of the very fancy models, however an utility smartphone for day to day use ... Wishlist for possible Dazen 1+ (?) .. 2 MB ram and improvement on data exchange aspect through some 'smart' applications and more 'English' part in themes and other options.Very happy with the phone so far.
