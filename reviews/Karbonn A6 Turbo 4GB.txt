107	shivam	Sep 01, 2015	Yes	karbon a6 turbo is a good device if you are not a very heavy user	if i say about snapdeal delivery  then it was great now  about phone i can  say that for a simple user it is good the sim supports only 2G and with extended use it itentds to get warm but not very warm. there is little bit of lags but thats okay for the price . camera quality is decent for the price it is selling. low light images is very poor compared to daylight. edges are sharp not curved. and battery may last a day if not in use other wise can give u 1hour to 2hour screen on time. you buy if you are not a heavy user.
108	Mohit kumar	Sep 01, 2015	Yes	good one	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
