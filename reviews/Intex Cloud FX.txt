17	Prasad Kumar	Oct 02, 2015	Yes	Average product	Agree that the product comes at a low price. So I don't expect any performance. Being a new platform I don't even wish to see tons of apps in Market. But the phone stutters while doing even simple tasks as opening a dialer or gallery app. Products like these bring a bad image to  a budding OS. Would love to see middle to high end devices from Firefox/
18	Sachin	Oct 02, 2015	Yes	Intex Cloud FX	The phone has good looks, but not very good in its touch response due to slow processor. It has very less internal memory and so you cannot install other apps. Touch is also not very responsive. I would not suggest this phone if you have a budget of 2000. You can better take any basic phone which will not disappoint you as much, for sure.

46	thendral	May 14, 2015	Yes	Very unmatured operating systm	You want to see an early stage smartphone os, just check firefox os. Its just buying beautiful bicycle without some parts missing on it.   With over confidence, Mozilla tried this experiment on this type of hardware. Good looking, ( imitating iphone ), modular apps assembled on a smart device, that is firefox. Hardware: A better OK for performance (android is running better on this hardware config). Because of firefox poor memory management design it crashes many times due to low memory.  Software: Ok for minimal use of a touch screen mobile. Nothing smart here, because lack of applications.   If you like listen songs, watch movies, call your loved ones and finally a show off to friends with cheaper price, you can go for it.  Others please neglect.

Though this phone don't have any menu opyion but it has got all apps in the homescreen. Which makes it very convenient to use. I dont think that any one would get such a nice phone at this price.

84	Ormaz	Mar 26, 2015	Yes	FireFox - The Operating System	I bought this phone for a senior citizen friend who was interested but apprehensive about how it would work out.  Well...he shouldn't have worried.  It is colorful, simple to use and quite reliable.  The form factor is pocket friendly.  Things that can be improved are: It should get a 1 amp rating charger and the battery should be bigger capacity and should fit more tightly.    Overall good value for a beginning to smartphones.

90	kamlesh kushwah	Mar 26, 2015	Yes	very smart phone	Battery is very poor quality phone is not good
91	avinash05singh	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	an average	Design is average,camera is good,touch is smooth and response quickly,interface is good.the main prblm is market of Firefox is it doesn't provide WhatsApp very popular app,and doesn't provide sharing apps and popular games.otherwise this product is good for those people who want to use a smartphone in under 2000 with brand and warranty.
92	Amighty	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	It is not a bargain	Looks OK and sturdy but Poor battery, one SIM is not recognizing after 2-3 months. Ringer stopped working and 2-3 months so not worth it. It may look like a bargain for the money but it is not.
93	Mahcbe	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	RAM is poor	RAM is very very low... Can't be worthful for the current age... Atleast they might have provided 256 MB with some reasonable additional price...  But if you want to have a different OS experience, then go for it...
94	Abhijit	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	BEST you can get @ this price	Intex Cloud FX is one of the best mobile, I have ever encountered.
95	Anomaly	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	great low buget phone	I am giving this review after using this for few months now.  Pros: really cheap, the sound quality is very nice even the headphone provided is great.the display is very nice and clear. A nice looking phone.   Cons: The touch screen is not that great, Battery backup is poor, quite large and heavy(i have small hands),there are lots of lags and responsiveness is very slow. not very good for surfing the internet. but if you want to buy a cheap android with really good sound quality i think this is a good choice.
96	sabah	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	: don't judge a book by its cover	It's Good & I liked it a lot.... But We can't easily download any apps
97	Joy_IIT	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	Good Product	For such a low price, this is quite a good product, but too many installation of apps within it makes it slow, but experiencing a new OS is just as fun

99	ANilkumar	Mar 17, 2015	Yes	Battery Is Very Bad	Life of the mobile is also very bad

108	Akhil	Mar 01, 2015	Yes	Average Phone	Small size handy phone good for ordinary user.Good for the price having a dual sim phone with samrt phone facilities.It has lag on touching and slow in sensing swipe.Using internet on this phone is like cutting head.
109	ngunaeelan	Mar 01, 2015	Yes	poor battery	battery not holding charge even for i/2 day have to recharge every 2 to 3 hours
110	yadav	Mar 01, 2015	Yes	Just a waste of time and money	It hangs often. You can't play any game. Internal memory is too low. Since it's not android u can't use whatsapp. If try using whatsapp using third party app,, the experience is horrible.Just a waste of time and money.Better buy a keypad phone than buying this one.Even u can't talk properly to the other person on line. internet surfing just a bad experience.I would not even like to buy this mobile at half-rate.
111	RangaRao M	Feb 12, 2015	Yes	Very basic phone	its very primitive phone, intended for incoming and outgoing only. It lacks the phone book contacts delete option.

116	jophy	Feb 12, 2015	Yes	never ever buy this phone!!!	Dear All,         this is a review that am writing after using Cloud FX for 4 months. 1. call is getting hanged most of the times. 2. Cant hear voice either from caller end/ receiver end. 3. takes 2 minutes of time to disconnect current call and initiate next call. 4.call clarity never be same. 5. touch lags all the time. 6. everyday it hangs up  atleast for 30 minutes all over. 7. whatsapp application never open ups properly. not at all good as comapred to original whatsapp application. 8.internet application is waste. 9. not good for call/internet. 10.tales too much time to shows up a new window. 11.power button never respond unless press 4-9 times.
117	Manoj	Feb 12, 2015	Yes	worse battery backup.	The battery backup of the phone is very bad.It gets drained very fast.
118	Vijay	Feb 12, 2015	Yes	Extremely Disappointed	Battery Backup is worst,touch not good,Speaker volume very bad.Don't buy this Phone.
119	Arghya	Feb 12, 2015	Yes	awesome....	Bought for my mom and satisfied.......

122	adi93	Jan 25, 2015	Yes	bang for buck....	pros:at this price point, good display,lag free experience cons: poor battery, loud speaker is ok ok...  at this price point this is a ultimate phone,the os targets at low end hardware,and hence ul have smooth experience,if u buy any android at this price point, it will lag to the hell, since android needs lot of resources to run smooth,and at this price point all the android phones r useless. The firefox os has all the must have apps, starting from whatsapp to facebook, so no worries,and as i told before that this os targets low end hardware,ul have no problem using it on 128mb ram.Coming to the audio jack output, well its really good at this price and stock/in box earphones r really good,coming to the display,its ultimate for 2k budget....overall its a great smartphone for those who r looking for a 2k budget smartphone, so go for it, u wont regret
123	M.Raj Kumar	Jan 25, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Really good and worthily for the money...good processing system,able to connect with social sites...highly recommended for budget smart phone...

127	Bubai	Jan 25, 2015	Yes	Good product	Yeah! It's a good phone to use. No problem for hanging down. At first all credits goes to Mozilla Firefox. Good customization with the Linux they made. 3rd party apps are supported in this phone also like whatsapp, facebook, twitter. If anyone planned to buy an android phone under the budget of 5000/- then I'd like to recommend them to this phone. Although, plenty of apps are not available in Firefox Marketplace but one can easily satisfied by its features. A minimal camera is given. Sound quality is good enough to listening music or voice calls.  Unfortunately, Snapdeal get me into trouble by delivering the faulty piece at first; but their return policy helps me a lot.
128	Harsha	Jan 25, 2015	Yes	excellent performance for unique users	only for those who wish to have difference among common... i have been using it for long time truly amazing experience and built quality,battery backup good. finally best product for best price..

150	Ramakrishna	Jan 19, 2015	Yes	True Value	The product is worth its cost in gold.It has got all the features of a "Feature Phone" plus many features of a "Smart Phone".The buyer will have best of both worlds.It looks sleek.It is menu driven and is just suited for a country like India where a vast majority of people are illiterates.No surprise that it finds a place amongst Top Ten Smart Phones of 2014 by a leading TV Channel NDTV Profit.The Firefox OS is an added attraction in that it burns all the probable viruses if they go near to it.The cost is affordable.We should particularly thank the manufacturers for keeping the price at affordable level.As the price is affordable,one should buy two phones at a time which can be kept as a "Stand-by" in the event of an emergency.What else does a consumer want?

162	Sen	Jan 02, 2015	Yes	My experience with Intex Cloud FX	I have been using an Intex Cloud FX smart phone which I had ordered on Snapdeal. After using the phone for the last two months the primary problem with the phone which I have experienced is the battery back up against 1200 mh lion battery provided with set is very poor. On the standby position even without using the phone battery gets discharged very fast. Due to this problem using inter net on the phone would be very difficult. However, it is good for normal incoming and outgoing call services compared to other features of the phone.The resolution on 2 mp camera is  better for day time only. Therefore one should think twice before  ordering the same phone online.

196	amd	Dec 10, 2014	Yes	Ok a Good phone - But software update...	My reviews : - Overall a good phone,  But software update is not working. I did a phone reset and the check for update doesn't work and it says "An error has occurred while downloading update".  Wifi works good and the market place is where we get all apps for firefox OS. Reg game - the 2048 game was good and even i won it. Voice quality - OK. but could not compare with Moto E etc. Display is OK. The Camera images are not sorted and hence difficult to view the last image and we have to search by the last number. Phone is not matured and it is half cooked and what i believe is that Firefox OS will be good competitor and hopefully it will be a good phone in the new releases and launches of Firefox OS.
197	rahul rao.d	Dec 10, 2014	Yes	goood	good

210	Raghu	Dec 06, 2014	Yes	Value For money	The product is worth for its price. It certainly offer most of the basic functionality you expect in a smartphone.  I liked the firefox OS. Though it has a long way to go, I think it is rightly projected as a first smartphone for those who are migrating from feature phone. It is easy to use and quite intuitive.   However is terribly slow due to low memory and sometimes does not  connect to the internet.
211	Vikram	Dec 01, 2014	Yes	Very Good Device for This Price	At This price this smartphone allowed you to feel much better. Allowed you to access youtube, Facebook and also multimedia features which is not available in other phone at this price.

216	khanday	Dec 01, 2014	Yes	wowwwwww	this mobile phone is so good,less rate
217	Ros	Dec 01, 2014	Yes	HTML5 is just not ready.	Well if you want to start working on firefox OS as a developer, its a best phone to start with because its highly buggy. So buggy that is sometimes show you the sourcecode of the app you are running instead of the app interface. Too slow. Very low battery backup. But One thing I must admit, I could have replaced it but I won't. As a programmer this is best phone if you want to start working on firefox OS not only as a app developer but also if you want to fork in OS itself. That's the price you pay yo leave on the edge of technology.

This has a basic standards and suitable for those persons who just wanna use their mobile for calls, text, browsing and music at moderate rate.  I used this mobile for more than 20 days and found only lag is its RAM as 128 its not able to manager too many background functions.  You have an alternate option to close the background app by having a hold on the User Icon given at bottom of thee display by frequent closure of apps by this method prevents your device from hanging and app crashes.  Awesome streaming experiences through you tube app I promise if your ISP is perfect then there won't be any buffering of video even at higher clarity.  Ringtones can be selected by downloading Ringtone picker app from Market and the tone should be of .OGG format to get selected.  whats app can be used from connect A2 default app and Display wise can be improved. Music is awesome both on headphone and Loudspeaker wise.  Battery backup is good without browsing for a long duration.  Video Playback is awesome plays Hd videos cool without ay lag. and Only thing I suggest is to kill the background apps and get a great experience.  Anyhow when compared to other brand models and price this is provides an awesome experience.

308	Ramesh	Nov 01, 2014	Yes	This is worth product for the money.	This smart phone has so many features.only draw back is Battery charging is not upto mark.
309	SOURAV CHOUDHURY,	Nov 01, 2014	No	worst mobile ever	I bought it from snapdeal . the features of the mobile was good but poor battery service battery charges shows full but after using it for 1 hour it shows battery low . Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy
310	Buyer	Nov 01, 2014	Yes	A good phone with a bad display screen	Overall the phone is very good but the screen is very dull and only visible with a certain angle. Thats a very bad experience. But at the given cost, its a good product if you can bear the pain to always adjust the viewing angle for the phone.
311	suvajit1995	Oct 30, 2014	Yes	A compromised gadget	The Phone has some really great features like Wifi at this price point. But 256 MB RAM will be a good go instead of 128 only cause it really lags if 2 or 3 more apps are installed. Battery life is also not good, need two full charges daily even for moderate using. There is a problem with screen brightness, often the brightness fall to 0% even if the settings shows it 100%(May be my device is faulty or it's a bug of current firmware). And Firefox OS needs more improvement to compete with Android.
312	meezan	Oct 30, 2014	Yes	bad fone	baddest fone instead of buying this buy a nokia bllack and white fone
313	venky	Oct 30, 2014	Yes	worst phone i.e INTEX CLOUD FX	The battery is very worst qlty.It will take for full charging-3 hours,it will empty within 8 to 9 hours in stand by condition and it will emptied within 3 to 4 hours if we used this phone for calls.And also there is a big problem for touch some times it will lagging,the calls can"t go.Totally dont by this,its a worst phone from intex.I bought this phone on the date of 21/10/2014 only.Within one week I am dissappointed with this phone.

319	Raghu GS	Oct 30, 2014	Yes	Overact	I have bought this mobile phone for my mom last month. The mobile phone is trying to compete with true smart phones with very minimal hardware specifications.  It tries to offers most of the features as a smart phone, but  once we start to use the available features, then, the mobile phone becomes annoyingly slow, even trivial actions like changing tabs in Dialing application or opening sms starts to lag so much.  I am facing occasional software issue which turns of Mic, we have to manually toggle off/on it for Mic to start working again.  I can still recommend this mobile phone, but you should not use all the offered features and you should still need to treat it like a feature phone.
320	ayan	Oct 30, 2014	Yes	UX Design	Thanking Snapdeal

The display is bright and the size of the display is also satisfactory. The speaker also sounds very well. The Firefox OS works well. Battery backup is satisfactory. Cons - The camera quality is very poor.] Overall this is a nice phone. You can go for it to try the Firefox OS for the first time.

331	Spacekilo33	Oct 27, 2014	Yes	Good phone for the price	Nothing much to write about this phone. From the price point, it is a genuine smartphone and not a feature phone. But FireOS market place is yet to mature and therefore apps are not readily available. Other than that, every thing about the phone is average including build quality but that was expected from this phone.However you can get Android phones if you throw in a 1000 bucks more. Go for this phone only if you are on a very tight budget and want a smartphone
332	ravi	Oct 27, 2014	Yes	budget phone...!!!!	Good phone for basic use. just like feture phone
333	Kets88	Oct 27, 2014	Yes	No available any OS update on net	m happy when i buy this mobile for my father, but at next moment i bullish to buy this product. bcoz 1) OS is not updeted 2)dual sim but not ask wich sim can be use when u calling 3)camera quality not gud, 4)memorry card detecting prob.4) ring volume is so low 5) it's say TFT screen but it's not TFT all u west ur mony to buying this product.
334	Suren	Oct 27, 2014	Yes	Worth of 2K, not recommended for Aged	I bought this for my MOM. The features were good, but the OS is slow. The the touch is not that effective for the aged person. The sound is average and the App were very least. The google apps doesn't work in this OS. So to summarize, recommended for beginners of touch screen smart phone and not recommended for aged or older peoples .
335	Gerard	Oct 27, 2014	Yes	A little slow	The phone looks neat. A little slow. Can take a while to bring up even simple things like your list of contacts. Does the basic functions. Have been using it solely as a feature phone. I'm sure it will get much more laggard if I were to download apps, browse the net etc.

365	m	Oct 22, 2014	Yes	Bad as compared to most basic phone	The phone's hardware is fine as a build quality is alright.. Software is basic, most features depend on the memory card. It is pathetic when you start using it for calling, writing text. So, in the first few hours, you really won't be able to know the issues upfront. It is only after few days that you get to know what you are dealing with. Call drops very often, the speaker is very bad, you will hate to take any calls... Touch sensitivity for writing SMS/text is not good at all.

The phone is very well built.OS is good but requires too many fixes.This phone just gets me through a day which is not expected from the phone, beacause its just a basic phone.

400	Balu	Oct 16, 2014	Yes	Too much heat and low sound	I purchased Intex Cloud FX on 28.09.2014 through Snapdeal. The mobile is looks good. But the following problem I facing everyday while I do conversation with people  1. The mobile is heating lot, so my ear is paining   2. The sound is very low (the receiver unable to hear my voice properly and me too.)  3. Always I needs to sought my voice then only the receiver can able to hear my voice Hence I would like change my mobile. It could be the same company or some other company such as SAMSUNG, NOKIA etc with the same price  Please suggest me what shall I do
401	Naren	Oct 15, 2014	Yes	Not yet ready	I bought this phone for my mom with the thought to give her simple touch screen phone with basic features +  WhatsApp.  By default WhatsApp doesn't work with FireFox so phone comes with bundled ConnectA2 which in-turn helps to connect WhatsApp. But after multiple attempts ConnectA2 did not work as it could not deliver SMS for activation code. So finally ended-up installing other tool. It works but again performance is too slow... and its battery drains very fast.   Contact import, merge duplicates etc are some good features, but overall response is too slow. At times it doesn't recognize finger touch so one needs to keep trying. There is no easy option to remove keyboard to move to next field - the option is to press home button and get back into the application for the next field.  At times my mom has also faced audio issue, but difficult to zero it whether its my phone, network or recipients phone as issue is sporadic.  Overall I feel product still needs to go through few more rounds of testing and some additional RAM.
402	Rajan	Oct 15, 2014	No	Not Good	I have problem in product.   I total unhappy   I want to replace it
403	jayapratap savarala	Oct 15, 2014	No	That's Good Stuff	Fits in budget for smart phones.

409	Sushma B.R	Oct 15, 2014	No	That's Good Stuff	The package delivered from snapdeal was perfect.   Pros: An amazing phone at such a low cost. Good screen display, very responsive touch screen. Applications open faster when compared to Andriod phones. Had to re-install ConnectA2 App as it was unable to connect to WhatsApp and after that it's just awesome. Firefox OS runs with such low resources is amazing.  Cons: Camera is not that great.  Battery could be of more power for longer charge.

413	Rajan	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	Nice and Worthable	Value for money
414	ThangaBarani	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	bad phone	RAM is very low .. cant load any big pages in browser.. there is no back option or button.once i clicked a link through fb it opens in browser and i cant come back to facebook.. can't restore the previous sessions.. charger not working.. have to buy seperately., the mic didn't work sometimes.. have to restart the phone and then it works, camera is garbage,many apps in market but i cant install it.. whatsapp only works if the date and time are perfect, cant switch sim easily, everytime i have to go settings to change. when i restart the phone all call defaults go to sim1 causes cost loss due to data, have to change once again
415	Ashim	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	awesome phone	Totally satisfied
416	kamal	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	Not upto it	The phone was very overrated,kept hanging on us. Snapdeal was very good about the refund part though and was not overrated  for service. Better to pay more and go for a slightly higher end phone.
417	Shikhar Akash	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	Its a parfact deal.	Intax Firfox Cloud is perfact deal by snpdeal this is my first android phone,its very cheep or best Quality with latest verson O.S. pleas purches this.
418	rishav	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	nice features	good phone
419	David	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	Low battery life and low quality of call	i got this item shipped - it was a disappointment, lot of feautures didnt work. 1. ConnectA2 didnt work 2. USB connection to PC didnt work. 3. sound quality was bad and other party could barely hear me. I sent it for servicing adn they told me they upgraded the software. but then the battery life was low, barely two hours out of the charger the battery would drain dry. again the same recurring problem with USB connectivity and bad quality of calls. Had to give it for servicing  again, this time he said i will enter it as a dead phone and have to wait for 10 - 20 days. lets see this time
420	Chandrakant S S	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	Bad Experience: DoNot Buy	The Mobile is not worth the money spend....instead buy Panasonic GD31..I have to send it for repair with in a month of it's purchase. I have doubt that it will last for a year or so...The Net is Very Very Slow. The Touch sometime have to be hard for mobile to react. Picture taken are OK if compared with it's price. Speaker is Good. FireFox OS has nothing new in it, it has copied the looks of Andriod which is a copy of iOS(apple iPhone)
421	hadI the hardest	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	SD service is awesome....	Its a good phone but not too smart. Internet is very slow difficult to use whats app n download the games.
422	Kani	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	VERY BAD PRODUCT DON"T BUY IT	HI FRIENTS PLEASE DONT BUY IT WASTE OF MONEY .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
423	babu	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	intel cloud fx mobile	price worthy
424	Raj Kumar Sahani	Oct 14, 2014	No	Not Good	It's pretty slow. The power button doesn't respond some times.
425	Sanjiv	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	Perfect for a Budget smartphone	For normal use, one should buy this as it is good & Value for money.  The problem is battery backup & the off-on button. The Camera is of poor quality.
426	yuva	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	i wont buy any more	battery is very very poor and very slow response.
427	bavi	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	fantastic phone	very good for senior citizens like us who do not require too sophisticated mobiles and yet get the smart use.suits all pockets too.This is our first android phone and we do not require a phone having features beyond this one.we strongly recommend this phone to everyone from young to old.One will not get anything better at this price.
428	Devendra Kumar	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	do not buy	its too boring phone. have so many disadvantages like.   1. after clicking photo not show in gallery 2. in one time only one sim can use 3. 1 Ghz proccesor but when download any game its going hang 4.some time scrolling not working 5. some time calling at time voice not listen to another side.
429	Venkatesh	Oct 14, 2014	No	Not Good	00000 rating
430	satyam	Oct 14, 2014	Yes	dont judge phone by price and cover	It has many problems as it not support dual sim.
431	arnuld	Oct 13, 2014	Yes	Great phone at 2K with some bugs	I bought this as a replacement for NOKIA 108:   Pros:  1) Signal Strength:  great signal strength. I have NOKIA 108 and had NOKIA 1208 and both constantly use to drop signals but Intex Cloud FX never ever drops signal.  2) Call Quality:  It is average. Neither great nor complainable. Voices are supressed a bit but audible. I think it was a good experience talking on this phone.  3) Ringer/Speaker:  Oh.. my, its really loud. Even in highly noisy environments you can hear it and at highest volume sound does not break (unlke those chinese phones)  4) Touch: touch quality is fine  5) Battery: Average battery. If 2G use is 24x7 then you have to charge it every 5 hours. But for me it lasted more than 24 hours for me because I used it like a feature phone  6) Firefox OS: I liked Firefox OS, it is simple, much simpler than Android and even compared to Windows.  It goes slow sometimes because of hardware limitations but never lags, I know 10K Androids that lag. Firefox OS does not.   Cons:  SMS: SMS service somehow does not behave correctly.  Somtimes you will receive an SMS hours later after someone sent it, sometimes you will not receive the SMSs and many times you will not receive any SMS whole day no matter how many friends sent you SMSs but as soon as you open the inbox you will got all those in one shot suddenly.   SMS timestamp: Lets say you read an SMS and hours later you want to read it again. Well you can read but it will not show the time of the message.   Keypad: QWERTY keypad is bit small but that may be because I am used to 4 inches phones.  Updates: No matter whether you are on 2G or on high-speed Wi-Fi, there is always error checking for updates.  If you use your phone basically for making calls then at 2K its great. All feature phones are nothing compared to this.  If you are planning on buy some Indian/Chinese phone for 1K then better get this for 2K. If you send lots of messages then I do not recommend it. What you want for 2K ?  Intex needs to check the phone properly for SMS and Update service bugs  before selling it. Calling, texting and updating phone are 3 basic operations.
432	nishu	Oct 13, 2014	Yes	i would buy this product again.	nice phone......

446	jays	Oct 11, 2014	Yes	poor battery backup	poor battery backup
447	Basudeb	Oct 11, 2014	Yes	Need better Hardware!	If you buying for only Firefox OS then wait for other manufacturer with better hardware configuration. Pros: Firefox OS. Cons: Low RAM (You try to zoom an image in galary it is sluggish, it freezes and closes); being a low memory device it looses some essential features like 'Auto correction' and 'Word suggestion'; poor Camera (Seems sensor is not 2MP); poor sound; mic not as sensetive as it should be. Experience: About a second after locking screen; immediately after unlocking and sometimes (not always) just touching screen to open apps like mail, message I hear a sharp noise coming from the back speaker (like spark) even in silent mode. If any certified buyer can confirm this whether they also experience this or not will be great.
448	venkyx	Oct 11, 2014	Yes	intex cloud fx at 1999 is a bus ride	and not a taxi ride... its one of the cheapest smartphones in Indian market, and there is value for money.   first of all, snapdeal delivered as promised without a hitch.  so that's a plus for them.  about the performance of phone, lets go into pros/cons cons: - low battery life.  it wont last the whole day if you use it often.  but if you have a charging point handy, then no problems  - low processing speed.  it hits after a few days of use.  there are many applications, but try to open a PDF file (through pdf viewer) for example - and you might give up waiting for the page to zoom, after couple of hours!  there are multiple factors, which makes it slow, but dont expect to use many apps.    - whatsapp doesnt work like in an andriod.  you can get whatsapp through connectA2, a third party software, but it has very limited options.  which makes it a disappointment right away.   pros: easy to use interface enough for a simple user, or as second phone its not a total 'dabba', but sturdy for its cost facebook is easily accessible good voice quality  so, all in all, a very economical buy for a limited user.
449	RAJ	Oct 11, 2014	Yes	ECONOMIC	DISPLAY GOOD,MOBILE HANGING,WHATS APP,ADOBE READER NOT SUPPORTED,NET SLOW,CAMERA VERY BAD
450	Ramesh	Oct 11, 2014	Yes	ok for 2k	Its just ok of 2000. I recommend buying this with following limitations:   1. battery life is too poor. it does not last even 5 hours. This is a big drawback.  2. firefox market place lacks some of the well known apps - like - whatsapp, wechat etc., which is a big turn-off for a phone like this.
451	sharma	Oct 10, 2014	Yes	nice product	nice product but RAM is the matter.
452	yashwant	Oct 10, 2014	Yes	simple and fantastic Mobile	low budget good product

462	vinothkumar	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	waste mobile	poor battery backup, sound is not good
463	sandy	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	worst phone	i will request to all don't ever buy it.
464	Vishu	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	Not justufy the price	Being a under Rs-2k phone you can't expect very thing, but when their are other brand in the market with same price bracket you need to have some thing special to compete with them.  My reviews are based on my 8 days of usage.  Pros.  1. Touch screen 3.5 inch, 2. Solid build quality 3. Nice sound quality of hands free. loudspeaker, earphone. 4. Easy navigation 5. Substitute of only Android gingerbread 2.3 not later. 6. Not looks cheap or budget phone.  Cons. 1. Poor battery performance. If you are on the wifi only 2 hours you have. 2. Lags sometimes. 3. Not for long conversation, out of battery soon. 4. Touch response is just average being budget phone. 5. No message tone only slight vibration of new message if you are using the mobile. 6. Connect A2 app to use whatsapp does not let you to copy text. Just use it to send or receive, nothing extra. 5. Profile photo on the connect A2 visible to yourself only not the other whatsapp friends. 6. Phone does not ship with pre installed calculator, you have to download it from firefox marketplace free of cost. Their you find many options. 7. Battery Mah can be added more, not enough in present. 8. Don't ask for the camera quality, better to not click anything or try at your own risk. 9. BIGGEST DRAWBACK IF THE PHONE IS KEPT ON STANDBY MODE FOR MORE THAN 1 HOUR AND SOME ONE CALLED YOU AFTER THAT, THE CALLER HEARS THE DIAL TONE 5 TIMES BUT YOUR PHONE DOES NOT RINGS. IT WILL START RINGING AFTER 6 DIAL TONE.  Not that bad if look at the price it comes in. A good substitute of people need a basic smart phone with only basic use no fun here. If you are want to try your hands on firefox os then buy it.
465	Amir ali	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	Good	Nice products I love it

467	manju	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	The perfect smartphone at this price	This is my first smartphone, till now i used lower end phone *very good looking phone. *FIRE FOX is very good and easy to use. *camera and sound quality is good *display is very good. *touch screen is very good and fast Intex can work on improvements of this phone in these fallowing areas *battery backup is average. *when we make call we should get option call should go from which sim call should go, switching sims will be great. *atleast one sim should support 3g and ofcourse they can slighty increase price also Anyhow great phone at this cost.Great service, got within 2 days. Thanks to Intex and Snapdeal.
468	Sourav	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	Really a great deal. Love the phone	This was my first smart phone and I was curious about Firefox OS. It's really cool. The camera quality is not great but all other features are great. No-one is believing that the price is so low. The screen display is bright and the processing speed is great.
469	rakesh n	Oct 09, 2014	No	Not Good	battery backup...............................
470	lofikul14	Oct 09, 2014	Yes	good phone for that price	i think this is good phone to start firefox os at that price . advantage      1.its a smartphone so u can do atleast 50 percent what other smartphone do     2.bigger screen size for that price      3.connect with your friends by a2app (whatsapp)     4.wifi/wifi hotspot sharing etc Disadvantage     1.poor bettery backup     2.bad camera quality not like real 2 mp      thats all

477	Dilip	Oct 08, 2014	Yes	Great OS trapped in worst hardware	I was way too excited about firefox os and bought it right away when it was launched. I must say I am utterly disappointed with this product. Camera is worst and useless. Phone is extremely Slow. Net loads slow even in WiFi. This hardware is not capable to run Firefox Browser. Should have been more ram to justify this os. Battery Life is pathetic. Charges way to slowly and discharges immediately. :) Some part of FireFox OS is confusing. Redial does not work as expected. dialing from call log requires extra step of going to contact and than fingering a tiny Phone icon. Pain  in the ....  MarketPlace is empty. No useful app. Even facebook app is nothing but the mobile view of facebook site, just a little slower. Positive Point is only one may be. Whatsapp replacement app Connect2al. It does work. Getting Whatsapp below 2K is good.
478	bashajani9	Oct 08, 2014	No	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	good

481	Shivam Kumar Maurya	Oct 08, 2014	No	That's Good Stuff	its a really amazing product by intex available at minimal price. ever wondered to have a smartphone below 2000.

555	Sudeep.S	Oct 03, 2014	Yes	Nice One But Need Improovements	Firefox should work on improving the performance of the phones running its Firefox OS very seriously. It should also optimize the energy efficiency of the OS. Battery backup is one of the main deciding factors that the users have in mind while selecting a smartphone.  There are a few good points about the Firefox OS too. We liked how Firefox has given the app permissions control in the hands of the user, and also liked its simplicity and ease of use. But, we don't think that you should get yourself an Intex Cloud FX phone. It is slow and also won't even last a day on full charge even if you don't play too much games on it.  So, better wait for the next Firefox OS phone. Period.

584	Sankar	Sep 30, 2014	Yes	My First Smart Phone Awesome Phone	I like this phone very much good looking and more features than expected. Firefox OS is great. Internet connectivity is fast. In Wify zone connectivity is more faster. For Rs2K budget you will get more features in this device. Voice clarity is also good.  Pros: Good looking. Touch screen is nice. Value for money Cons: Battery consuming more while using apps.
585	cvg	Sep 30, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud FX	The battery drains very fast. In fact, the charge drops by about 50% within about 12 hours. Also there seems to some problem with out going calls: people at the other end cannot receive the audio. This can, however, be modified by switching off the phone and re-switching it on again. On the whole, I am very disappointed that I bought it. The only attractive feature is the price but even that is no longer attractive.

Also not many applications available on Firefox OS. If some one can advice on how to manage the battery I would be very grateful. Awful camera as well. I thought the camera would be a decent one but was disappointed to see such a poor camera. Also Snapdeal.com had given an ad in Times of India full front page saying The smartphone of India. I am afraid  the Smart phone is far from smart and would go to the extent of saying its not a smart phone but a dumb phone.

You cannot have more apps, because of 128 MB RAM. Think 100 times before purchasing this mobile, but as a normal mobile it is very good. Looks like a I phone.

635	HEMANTH	Sep 27, 2014	Yes	waste	SIMPLY ONE WORD, WASTE...
636	samirg	Sep 27, 2014	Yes	Good Start	The FireFox OS has a lot of promise but they need to improve the hardware, Battery is pathetic, screen touch and overall touch experience needs to improve.  Heavy sites are difficult to navigate, phone hangs when on these sites.   Battery life is just pathetic, drains our every 2 hours or so, i have to permanently tether it to my laptop for power. Screen size is very small and the keypad difficult to type in. Apps are ok, i like the fact they are HTML5 but they dont give the same rich experience which i get from IOS.  Phone calling is ok, buttons seemed a but laggy.  I sorely miss Skype in the phone, i hope they come out with a version soon.  Oh the camera is best avoided.  So what is the point of buying such a phone. For one it looks very charming, i mean the UI is quite fascinating, keeps me very engaged despite all the glitches. The I am thinking of feature is very interesting I hope they build on that, it could rival google as a search feature.
637	ms	Sep 27, 2014	Yes	battery backup	Battery backup is not good other wise OK.

641	amit	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	the power of firefox fx is on going	very fast and highly responsable operating system...... i recommend this for everyone  low cost and high features  are the strength of this handset.......     it would become every one choice  ..................

643	Ralph	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Good Value	The Intex Cloud FX mobile phone is a good buy. The Mozila OS works fine without any problems, the phone is also pretty good with touch screen  and dual SIM feature, the micro sd slot can take 8GB sd card. The only draw back with this mobile is the battery which appears to be of poor quality the charge doesn't last for more then 3 to 4 hours when not in use.
644	Devan	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	GOOD	Its Very good for Rate. And Also the Performence of Phone is so good.Some times its work slowely, but overall its very good.
645	Ramji	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud FX	The item purchased is not good at all. I think online selling of the things should be done only after passing the minimum usability test of the item.
646	gautam	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	don't buy it at any cost	if this phone is free ! still think if you had enough time to operate it. even searching contact from contact list is also a task ans will waste your 3-5 min
647	Vicky watts	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	I would buy this product again	Excellent mobile in Snapdeal at lowest price
648	Jothi	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Battery charge discharged soon	Battery charge is last within an hour though it shows 100% charge completed. After 100% charged, within an hour the battery gets discharged to 0%.  I want to replace my product.

656	Sachin	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Bad product	Battery lasts only for 5-6 hours despite not using wifi. This is the biggest turn off!  Wifi works only for g and not for n. OS needs to mature.  No easy way to transfer contacts from a nokia phone. Could not do it via Bluetooth. Had to copy contacts in a SD card and then read back. Reading back in the Intex took lot of time.
657	Rana	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Product not good	Product not good, OS also fail, not worth

664	Raj	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Excellent device at this price	For 2000 INR you are getting a fully functional smart phone that too pretty simple to use for a first time smart phone user. You can easily install apps from market place without requiring any mail logins.   Fxos is pretty new to India and cannot compared with Android since this is pretty good platform at it's price. Battery is good for the price and features in the phone.   Go for it !I bought 6 devices for now family so far and much satisfied.
665	Subho	Sep 26, 2014	Yes	Nice	This Mobile is perfect for my mom, only one thing is missing (3g). great touch response, good internet speed, at this price good phone..

675	Yogesh Patel	Sep 25, 2014	Yes	Perfect for Rs 2,000 Phone	Ideal replacement for any featured phone. For Rs 2,000 you get touchscreen phone, dual SIM support, good finish quality. If you feel that 128 MB RAM too low, let me tell you that you should know Firefox OS phone can run on even low RAM as well. They doesn't require that high amount of RAM found on Android phones.  I am blogger and completely happy to review this phone. Would rate it 4.2/5 and battery life should have been improved.
676	s.k.johari	Sep 25, 2014	Yes	its battery discharges even when unused	its battery discharges even when not in use .....
677	Pradeep	Sep 25, 2014	Yes	Great phone in 2K.	This is nice experience of Firefox os, pro:looking grate, nice tuch responce, low cost.and cons: poor camera quality with no adjustment, poor battary performance, no games.

679	Baala	Sep 25, 2014	Yes	I would like to buy things through snap	Yes i would like to share information about the product.my rating stabds on average because of the product performance and clarity stands on tha level.
680	Vinodh	Sep 25, 2014	Yes	touching	firefox OS is good but touching sense little bit slow, this product is worth above this price
681	None	Sep 25, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud Fx	Don't know if my fingers are too fat or the space is too small or what but whatever I click, something else appears, I have to backspace and type again! Still learning (at age 57!) to use a SmartPhone, I guess. Not really very comfortable with it, and add to that my failing eyesight as age advances!
682	683	Srinivas	Sep 24, 2014	Yes	FUNCTIONS ARE DIFFERENT	I am not used to it finding some inconvenience when compared to my previous instruments.
684	sintu	Sep 24, 2014	Yes	amazing fone	five out of five best price and excellent feature.
685	Jatinder	Sep 24, 2014	Yes	Good product	This is a really good product. The only drawback is the camera images quality and the slow speed (RAM). But for surfing internet and calls this is an excellent option in this price range. Battery is really good provided you keep a check on the applications running on your mobile (i have read comments that battery is not good but that is not true. Yes if many applications are running you will surely run out of battery early).

A new experience as part of new Firefox os.I bought a new Intex Cloud phone last week,very sad to say that Alarm is not working.There is no Calculator,we need to download calculator app from market.Also so far i did not find any settings to keep my phone in silent mode.

Overall, its a great choice at this price range. This phone is really a Value For Money.

718	Prasoon Singh	Sep 24, 2014	Yes	NOT QUITE SATISFACTORY	The looks are good. quality is also good. touch screen works fluently. good smartphone for beginners!! The major problems are- The battery backup is too low as compared to other smartphones.  Neither back cover nor any other cover is available for phone in market. You can set only one default SIM card for calls, messages. If you want to call from SIM2 then you will have to go to settings and change the default SIM as SIM2 then only you can call or message from other SIM. Camera is without flash which is a must when you say "Smartphone". Please take care while opting for this. Screen guard for this phone is also not available. You have to opt for teflon guard. Overall the product is good for beginners but if you are a pro then you must not go for this.

The positives in this phone which I felt is its touch sensor & Wifi connectivity(which isnt avail on any other very low priced phones). Very imp point is that the firefox OS is very basic.
773	USU	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Average handset	The handset gets heated up like an oven within one hour of switching on the set.The battery drains very fast even with minimal use.
774	narayan	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	"The product is small with simplicity"	the mobile is quite good but the application's are quite poor with poor battery life & has to be connected to recharge more often than to use.

782	Sushanth	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Nice phone for the price	Nice phone for the price but not for someone who needs the smart in the smartphone... Con's: 1. Low RAM kills the phone. Takes a long time to load any app. Not something you would like in your first phone if you are coming from a feature phone. 2. No option to call from 2nd Sim directly from the dialer. You have to go to the setting and change the Sim card to be used. 3. Bad camera. Needs full day light to take a good picture. Pros: 1. Low cost. 2. Easy to learn. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
783	patil	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	NIce	as compare apple os but it's very slow ......
784	Mr. Awesome	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Poor battery life	Great features in this price range but camera and battery worst. . Also big websites hang the device.. And we have to remove battery and restart..

Update shows error while downloading. 5. Marketplace shows no help on apps. 6. Call log does not distinguish which sim is used.  Pros: 1.Touch is good. 2. U get wifi and bluetooth in low price.  Bottom Line: I will recommend this to a friend only if whatspp connectivity issue is solved.
793	Subrat	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Poor Battery	The phone OS is definitely good! But the Battery does not last even 12 hours on standby. Would suggest a hike in the price to accommodate a better battery. Other wise a good phone will have the utility of a paper wight only.
794	chinu	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	nice nd affordable	is a nice product , simple nd worth of its rice
795	shitanshu	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Not much to expect.	In dual sim, battery works for 10 hours only in standby. If talking a lot, it requires recharging in few hours only, so battery performance unsatisfactory. Running video is not smooth.
796	abhishek rohankar	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	good option	good option in smartphone section ,
797	jeevan mathai	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	intex fire fox	first let me point out the few good points in this phone. yes the phone looks nice. resembles an i phone 4.In fact the cover for i phone 4 slips in very well too thus disguising the 2000 rs phone for a twenty thousand one!!!The display is fantastic. and...well unfortunately the list ends there.Now for the real problems in this phone. This phone just does not work in any Wi-Fi situation!!!This is terrible because browsing is impossible. Even in sim card data connect, browsing is painfully slow. Wassup comes and goes on and off as if it has a mind of its own. Also wassup messages dont come with options like "delete",share","froward" etc.battery lasts an entire day but only if you are not using Wi-Fi or data. If you use Wi -Fi or data, battery drains out in a couple of hours
798	H	Sep 21, 2014	No	Battery Backup low	Once we charge fully, the battery comes up to 10 hours. Camera quality is not up to the mark. Screen is very sensitive. I am amazed by the touch feature. It works very well. They should improve the battery backup. It is very important.

807	Annoyed user	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Not useful	Battery backup is very bad .12 hrs of charging leads to battery life of 6 hrs.  Looks like basic features are ignored like battery ,display during the call etc..  Though touch feature is excellent , without basic features its more of kid's toy .If u take it considering it as phone u will regret.
808	Umesh Hegde	Sep 21, 2014	Yes	Goood Mobile	Thanks to Snapdeal.com bcz introdusing lowest Price OS Mobile phone Intex Cloud FX. Its very usefull to net browsing,downloading songs but Camra not satsifed...

She has been using the qwerty phones for a while and always resisted switching to touch phones..And it has been a smooth ride from Day 1. Now she tells me about the pictures she sees on facebook which keeps her engaged in those lonely moments....The speaker should be louder..
813	Amol	Sep 20, 2014	Yes	Good for first time Smart phone buyer	Pros: Touch Screen, Nice User Interface, Easy to operate, light weight  Cons: Battery gets drain within a day.

825	babai	Sep 20, 2014	Yes	ok .....can go 4 it	with a sum of 1999 bugs.... the product is ok. The camera quality is worst i have ever seen in any handset. The net speed is good when the signal strength is maximum(wifi/edge). The touch is fine. The you tube app is a waste because the phone doesn't support the play format. you can't store too many songs in memory card, as the phone get hang and it gets shutdown. The look and design is fine for the price. You can't use whats app, nor the mozila market place function properly. If you are looking for social apps like whats app or other messenger app like hike , better to look for some other anroid handset, as this  doesn't support any. overall features provided with this price tag is ok. But not really satisfied with this product.

868	Run of the mill chap	Sep 19, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud FX - Early Verdict	I bought it after reading about it amidst the great media hype leading up to its launch (at least for those who follow tech journals).   I havent had the chance to use the phone much/at all because I got it for my mother who I thought should find it easy to use moving up slightly from a feature phone. I'd read from early user comments about the poor battery life (some said 4 hours standby) & I was concerned as I'd already ordered but it works better than that to say the least.   But I must admit the best use case for the phone is for those who don't need browsing much/at all & simply text and call. Otherwise, I would rather pay a little more & get an android OS over Firefox. I've not tried using the browser or installing Apps which Intex claims work on the FX Cloud so I won't comment at this point.   I think a more detailed review could come later when I see & use / test the phone myself but for the purpose I purchased it - it does a great job.

882	cris iyer	Sep 18, 2014	Yes	Intex CloudFX doesn't match the hype,	Operationally it isn't very user-friendly, though it may be the cheapest smart phone.  Battery runs down too quickly, sometimes  in 3 or 4 hours even when not put to use.  In other words, one isn't certain how the battery full charge would last.  Since I hadn't used a smartphone hitherto, I thought it fit to go in for this cheaper piece.  But, then, I am not satisfied with the product.
883	yesvee	Sep 18, 2014	Yes	not upto the expectations	unable to connect internet. 3G is not available

891	AVG	Sep 18, 2014	Yes	for the price...	For the amazing price, it is good for beginners. One would like if it responds little faster and have more connectivity options. For the price, it is the best buy to try out as your first smart phone.
892	sangeeth	Sep 18, 2014	No	very bad battery discharge without use	The battery drains fast even without using any apps/sims. Buying this phone was a poor choice. I lost my money and peace of mind.

899	Pintu	Sep 18, 2014	Yes	Good Budget smart phone	Good Budget smart phone for the behiners
900	Venu	Sep 18, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud FX	I am happy with the device,except for Battery back up wh          ich is very slow to recharge and does not last long.
901	IS	Sep 18, 2014	Yes	For Rs 1999, a good buy	This smartphone is slow, the screen isn't good, the camera is quite terrible, the browser experience is average, but when you look at the price tag, it's not bad at all.

906	Gagan	Sep 17, 2014	Yes	really its challenge to android	Nice phone with wifi and 2g. There is value for money. Competition to android would be always beneficial to customers, as android changed the scenario when Nokia, Bleckberry and iPhone were booming. Thumbs up for Firefox OS. snapdeal shuold offer sd card with this, as internal memory is low.
907	Vijay	Sep 17, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud Fx	It is bad.
908	Parthasarathi	Sep 17, 2014	Yes	Nice phone for the beginners	First time I'm using the smart phone. Wow. So nice mobile. Its true, its purely for the people like me who used feature phones till now.   Still that promo code is not activated.. I'm trying trying, aircel is not activating it..

913	Ankur	Sep 17, 2014	Yes	Best Product	The Cloud FX smartphone sports a modest form factor based on the Firefox reference design unveiled earlier this year by Mozilla. The phone is compact and is not very heavy. Made of plastic, the phone feels solid and durable, and there were no creaks and wobbles even though it features a removable back cover. In a world dominated by Android and iOS (to a small extent Windows Phone), it is interesting to see a new mobile OS platform. It is even more intriguing that it focuses on entry-level devices and is optimized for low-end hardware. With Firefox OS, Mozilla's intent was to create an open mobile OS platform that could benefit emerging markets where sometimes, mobile devices are the only medium to connect to the internet. Mozilla's Firefox OS is built entirely using HTML5 and other open Web standards. Any web service complying with the same standards can be used as an app. Having said that, Mozilla ships the OS with some core apps, while other installable apps and games are available through the Marketplace.  over all best product at best price
914	rad	Sep 17, 2014	Yes	Intex Fx Cloud	Pros : Touchscreen & Design Cons : Very very slow process/display even after inserting 2 GB micro SD card & Though Dual Sim Phone, only one can be used for outgoing after setting.  No option to select the Sim before calling.

The only cons i found is the battery and camera...The battery back up is very poor as  it is a 1250 mAh Lion battery,it only gives 4 hours of back up and takes at least 2 hours to charge....Camera is even worst as they have told that it is 2 mega pixel camera ..it does not take any clear pictures...Even nokia 2700 classic has also 2 mega pixel camera but it takes sharp pictures...Besides this two cons the over all experience is good for me....and one thing guys if u buying for whatsapp then its not work,and if u r loooking for camera than don't buy it...Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices.

982	Mahesh	Sep 16, 2014	Yes	Refreshing change with a new OS	Pros: Low cost, All the basic features of smart phone is there -> internet, whatsapp (using Connect A2), facebook, games etc.  Cons: The battery life is very ordinary, the phone response at times is slow would test user patience-> might be because of the cheaper hardware.  I have been using this phone for about 2 to 3 weeks, so far I am happy with the phone apart from the daily battery recharge need though my usage is minimal.

1019	prkreddy	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	cost effective, but lower backup time an	Cost effective phone but Back uptime while using wi-fi is very low. Alarm function is not working properly.
1020	arifaraheem	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	My experience on Intex Cloud FX.	I have been using Intex cloud FX, since last five days. It's performance is OK at the price I paid. My first experience on Firefox OS is satisfactory, expecting many more good days from firefox in feature. Camera is average, but good enough to click a snap for adding a photo into contacts. Battery's performance is very poor, even with out using any apps & other utilities other than basic phone, battery goes low within three to four  hours. It is not suggestible for the people on the go. Other than the battery issue mostly every thing is OK. Specially the contacts are comfortable, we can enter as many phone numbers for a single contact as required. We can add photo of the contact and many more details of a individual can be saved for feature use. Unfortunately, the contacts in the phone cannot be synced in the PC or we cannot get a backup of contacts transferred to the PC at go. Phone lacks torch light, which could have been handy in case of need in the dark. I strongly recommend not to go for it, if your basic phone usage(talk time) is for around half an hour daily, as the battery may not bare with you. Other than the major issue of battery, I am satisfied with the other functions of the phone. The touch response of the screen is good. Look and finishing of the phone cabinet is good for the price paid. FM radio function which is provided is very good, tuning of the radio, adding favorite channels are good. The music player's audio quality is Ok. The ear phones included are OK. I feel lack of PC suit software to connect the phone with PC. Browsing experience of mine on this phone is satisfied, we must not go multi tasking. Browsing with a little patience is recommended. Alarm function is OK.   Calendar and schedules function is satisfactory. Voice recording is not yet used by me. Video player is also not yet used by me, To be frank, I am least worried for multimedia functions i.e. audio & vedio player, face book etc, very rarely I'll tune in to FM. Wifi and Bluetooth functions are trouble free.  In near feature I shall approach intex service centre for rectification of the battery issue. If they feel helpless, then the matter will be worst.  I recommend all to think twice for the performance of the battery, other wise every thing is good for the price we are paying.
1021	Gopal	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	The battery backup is very worst	The battery backup is worst and Its not even lasting for couple of hours.
1022	kamal	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	intex cloud fx	battery not up to standard (as written in booklet)
1023	Himanshu	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	bought this phone a week ago	The product is average in line with its pricing. The battery does not last for long even in standby mode. The SAR value is high but within the permissible range. Not sure why they dont mention it. I had to call up intex to find out. They told me it is 0.75 but on the box it says 1.21. I called them to understand why there is a difference. They said 0.75 is min and 1.21 is max. The camera is below average and there is a visible lag while using the phone. Overall a cheap product. Android phones are far better.
1024	madhu	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	Perfect smart phone with wi-fi	I stongly suggest the customers to buy this product from snapdeal.
1025	PG the "mobile explorer"	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	The best phone in 2k range.my intu foxy'	i had been a week using this phone and i never felt this phone as a low budget type of phone as it always gave me a smartphone like experience.  graphics are really good for a phone of 2k and also the phone is really that much brigth enough to drain the whole battery within 2-3 hours of use.  videos can be played only upto "480p".if you force the phone it may even play a 640p video but with lot of lag.  and really you will have a good experience with this phone during youtubing. i watched many videos in this phone and in none of them i find any buffering. it was really awesome and the video quality was also good.  and one thing i ave to tell you about "INTERNAL STORAGE" which most of the complained here about lack of storage but for this phone it is more than enough.  i personally installed more than 15 apps which were downloaded from fx marketplace and all of which were working without any lagexcept some graphical games. you will get 70 mb for apps storage and none of the apps will be more than a "mb". for some high end games like candy crush the size will be 3mb but then also approximately you can install more than 50 apps in this 'hybrid smartphone'.  software updates are also possible in this phone and i already got one. and if you are worring that in this phone you would not get any update then dont worry its there.  in this phone you will get all the basic apps pre-installed while you can download all othres according to your need.  I suggest all the intex fx usres to turn off their screen lock, because whenever you lock your screen all the data which got loaded during your use will get deleted from temporary memory and when yo turn on your screen angain it will take time to load.  the above told thing is very effective and you would experience it whenever you would use internet. even the pages which got load will again load if you lock the screen and again unlock it aftre some time but it is not such when you dont have screen lock as its directly shows the page.  the camera is average. only in a good sunny day the photos taken wold be like a 2mp clicks otherwise they would be worser than a 0.3mp camera. the camera app is vey simple with no sttings at all. only optiopn we have is to click photo. in this cam you camera you cant zoom and long shots will be full of pixellation.  one of the best part in part of the phone is tis music app which is even better than android app. even the sound calrity is nice and also its speakers are loud enough that even your neighbours can enjoy your songs.     it also has a good back cover which dosent attract any scraches which is a good thing.  you will not get any screen guard with this phone so as soon as you get this phone you have get one from the market.  and the most important thing is that if you want to exploit all of its features than you must have an internet connection and then you would really enjoy the phone.  AT LAST ONE QUESTION TO ALL THE USERS "YAAR HOW TO COPY TEXT IN THIS PHONE, I REALLY TRIED ALL METHODS BUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND IT. PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU KNOW"
1026	drcnislam	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	New Intex Cloud FX	Sorry! Bad luck for me! Money spent for Nothing! When I turn camera on ,it NEVER OPENED! THE PHONE HANGS!
1027	stish	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	value for money	good stuff whats app works fine
1028	Mithun Rock star	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	A android phone worth the money.	This is a competitively priced Android phone. All fuctions which is available on a mid-range phone is incorporated in this device. What is lacking is a user manual, one which is supplied along with the unit is not explanative and information are premitive in the user manual. Suggest that Intex also recommend suitable cover for the phone, which is not available in the market.
1029	Jay	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	Product doesn't live upto its promises	The company Intex tried to do with this phone what Tata tried to do with Nano. Where Tata succeded (more or less) Intex doesn't. I recieved the phone three days ago and since then the phone hung mid-process three times. And when it gets hanged I cannot even recieve phone calls. I also tried installing Whatz app...but cannot and everytime I try to install the phone gets hanged again. I have gone, in desperation, back to using my old Nokia music express. Very bad experience for me.
1030	Shyles	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	Acceptable but battery drains out	For me it is fine as I don't travel much and don't use mobile much but for people on the move it is not the right phone as the battery drains pretty quick without doing much ..rather nothing
1031	Gangadharan	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	Cheapest smartphone; pricey paperweight	Cheapest smartphone; costliest paperweight. How would you like a phone that you need to charge three times a day? or keep it perpetually on charge? If you do, this is just the phone for you.   I sent 12 SMSs from many other phone, just three of them were received. The others were just lost. you call it  a phone? even the cheapest Nokia or unbranded phone gets it right!
1032	kiran	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	i would like product	Its so good in small cost
1033	pratyush	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	decent phone!	good looking design pros:- i was able to connect whatsapps using built in Connet A2 app. the touch is responsive. cons;- the camera is pathetic the phone gets hang on continuous use. the battery life is poor. but this price range it is worth going for it.

1054	Prabhanjan	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	Pathetic product this Cloud FX	Please don't go by the single star. Its way to pathetic than that. The music player and ring tone don't function at all. One needs to press the mobile very hard in the lower mid-half part for the sound to be audible. I thought such unreliable mobiles were not manufactured at all. I can't be more wrong. Please keep a mile distance from all Intex products.

1062	Arun	Sep 14, 2014	Yes	Cheap, but still undercooked UI	The phone is good and even at 128mb RAM it performs more than I had expected. The swypes are smooth, and screen is good. The phone looks sturdy as well.  However, it does hang every now and then, and some things do not work. For WhatsAPp there is a third party app called Connect A2 which does the job. My biggest problem is that phone does not show what version of FF OS it has and also gives error when trying to update. Over all I will give it 3/5
1063	Zafar	Sep 13, 2014	Yes	Do not meet requirement	I have the following concerns.  1. Batter is of bad quality,leave apart talk time, its stand by time is  not even 8 hours, battery is  getting discharged very quickly even after fully recharged.  2. Internet browsing is dead slow.  3. Camera quality is not at all good, even we are not able to recognize the photos, my old phone camera is better than this one which is having only 1.3 mega pixel camera.

Phone is really good and contain all the things that one can expect from this range of product.My only concern is its battery life,which is not looking as good as it should be.Interface is pretty nice and camera quality is also decent considering the price.If someone wants touch screen experience in low budget,then go for it.

1124	SunilGuptaSG	Sep 11, 2014	Yes	Let us not forget the price	A phone like this will be a game changer - pushing out feature phones and making smart phones available to most people in India. This phone costs less than what the 'brick' Nokia's costed years ago.  Works well - worth every rupee.   Takes a bit getting used to as there is no back button, just a single button like the iPhone.

1172	Subra	Sep 10, 2014	Yes	Feeling hurt	Though the feel of phone looks good, The Battery Plays a spoil sport. it does not even last for 8 to 9 hours.  Though the signal level is good, the moment SIM is enabled the BAT starts discharging heavily and gets drained even with out any usages.
1173	Thiyagaraj	Sep 10, 2014	No	smart phone at price of normal phone	surely a good deal for those who don't have a smart phone and wan't the basic smart phone features, but don't wan't to throw away lot of money in today's phones which will get outdated in 1-2 yrs Also, it is an open source OS Cool firefox!
1174	Saugata Roy	Sep 10, 2014	Yes	NOT impressed at all	I bought the phone because I love FireFox and Mozilla and was curious about the new OS. The price was unbelievable as well and further fueled my curiosity.   However, I'm not at all impressed with the phone. The hardware especially the battery is pathetic. Also the marketplace has few basic apps. The SD card slot is bigger than a microSD unlike most of the mobiles available in the market. The user interface is also not as intuitive as an android phone. Another small annoyance I found was the keyboard shows all characters as uppercase at all times. There is no way to make out if the character I'm about to enter is upper or lower case without actually tapping on the character. The dialer doesn't filter contacts by name. I also didn't find any copy-paste option or copy selection. In fact I was unable to drag and select text.  The OS has just been launched and might have potential to develop into something bigger in future. But I'm afraid it will get rejected by unsatisfied users long before that.
1175	ashu	Sep 10, 2014	Yes	money matters	bateery backup is poor,hangs frequently

1186	harsh	Sep 10, 2014	Yes	Perfect development phone	First of all this is not android phone. It has a different operating system firefox os. This phone is meant to be for the first time smartphone users. However still more useful for those who develop mebapps. At this price point, this phone packs a punch. Good battery life and visually appealing interface. May get slow if number of apps in use increase just like android. Only minus point is that camera is not good. May be a software update will improve the performance. Again great Firefox device at such low price. Recommended device.

DOUBLE-SIM, 1GHz Processor - RUNS ALMOST ANYTHING 3.5inch Touch screen - GREAT MOVIE EXPERIENCE  Cons -   RAM is 128 MB Expandable memory is 4 GB  Overall its value for money. There is no contender to beat this phone in the present market at the given price range. GO FOR IT.
1202	RAVINDRANATH	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	CHEEPER BUT NOT WORTY	1. BATTERY PERFORMENCE IS POOR... MAX 10 TO 12 HR AFTER FULL CHARGE. 2. CAMERA  - JUST THINK THAT CAMERA IS NOT THERE IN THIS MOBILE.. 3. SPEED - SLOW AND NOT USER FRIENDLY. 4. BODY IS NOT THAT MUCH STRONG.  BEST USE : FOR THOSE JUST TO SHOW THAT HAVING SMART PHONE AN NOT FOR REAL USE. BECAUSE IT LOOK LIKE APPLE PHONE.  THIS IS THE ONLY BENIFIT.
1203	ash	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Intex Cloud FX is not so good	Intex Cloud FX is not so good but looking at the price it is awasomne. internal memory is lacking so much that no pic can be taken by camera unless u insert the external mem card
1204	indra	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	mice and affordable	this mob set is very nice. and best performance
1205	vinayak	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Good Phone in Nice Price	I proud TO Buy this Phone And also Nice Function
1206	k.p.singh	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Product is not good,	I received this product and use only one day after it it's off during charging and not on so product is not good and also my experience with snapdeal is not good because i purchase any product first time form them ans want to so many product from there but first impression is bad............
1207	Inder	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Basic phone	This is like a basic phone you cant even use internet properly, many times it doest support wifi. Moreover facebook does not refresh automaticaly you have to do so with your manual efforst.Battery backup is toooo poor when you use wifi it goes last 2 hours.so i would never reccomend to anyone because without using internet it drains battery very fast average 10% an hour.so go with android phone minimum battery 1400 mah . Thanks
1208	Anto	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Not up to mark	Phone incoming, out going voice dead.
1209	Ankit	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Not that much of good	This is my second smart phone, but not much of better compared to my old smart phone.  Touch screen is getting struck and speaker is not at good, solar charge is not working properly.  But one thing is i wish to say is the features of the product is good specially marketplace.
1210	Admireal	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Poor Battery	Phone is okay in terms of UI but very poor UI.
1211	G A Raju	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Battery	Though the cell is not in use, it is forced to recharge within 24 hours
1212	RINKU GOEL	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	watsapp not ablable in this phone	watsapp not ablable in this phone
1213	Abhinav - the Shopoholic	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	All about Intex Cloud Fx	Well, if you look at the price tag and then unbox the phone and go through the screens for a while, you would realize you have grabbed a stealer.  But then, phone hanging every now and then, too many lags in navigating, below-par camera, bad earphone sound and inconsistent design among screens are what let it down.  But then again, I look at the price tag and am satisfied with it :)
1214	MOHAN	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	INTEX CLOUD FX-  BATTERY PROBLEM	BATTERY IS NOT WORKING AS PER SPECIFICATIONS I.E. 4 DAYS/ 4 HOURS. AT BEST ITS PERFORMANCE IS AROUND 25% OF THE SPECIFIED TIME. OTHERWISE, IT IS VALUE FOR MONEY.
1215	Dharmendra	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	POOR BETTRY	POOR BETTRY
1216	vijay	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	worst mobile from Intex	worst phone from intex, battery back up is pathetic for every half an hour u have to recharge ur mobile if ur browsing internet. voice speaker is also worst other person who calls u not able to hear  ur voice, u have to speak very loud on voice calls.  ConnectA2 doesn't work , which they advertise it as big advantage. And the internet bitter slow.  My suggestion is dont buy this phone, compare to this micromax is the better option for cheap mobiles.  I had made wrong choice by seeing their advertisement.
1217	Shweta	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	Battery Problem	Battery drains within an hour
1218	knk2459	Sep 09, 2014	Yes	DON'T JUDGE THIS PHONE BY ITS OUTER LOOK	SLIM, BEAUTIFUL LOOK. BUT THE PHONE NOT WORKING UP TO THE MARK.DON'T KNOW WHETHER MINE IS A FAULTY ONE.

1224	Sujit	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	Not A Great Deal.	Too much slow and very low memory. Overall poor performance.
1225	i.k	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	battrey  has very poor & low quality .	the phone has hang during use & the battrey is also very poor quality.
1226	vishnu	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	intex cloud fx	intex cloud fx is very slow & some time software is hang  tourch is not working proper  battery is very waste
1227	manoj	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	whatsapp not supported	social media not supported in this phone
1228	Mamta	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	Speaker doesn't work properly !!!!!!!!!	We received the product its good however speaker of mobile doesn't work there is no volume.
1229	AADI	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	great oppurtunity	very nice product
1230	MUKESH	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	Waste of money	Nothing good in this phone. Looking at the advertisement campaign I was impressed but upon using it proved to be waste of money.
1231	Jeseel	Sep 08, 2014	No	2G connectivity and No Whatsapp	Firefox OS is a Html 5 based OS and is not so familiar.  The phone is ultra cheap and lacks many appplications like whatsapp which works in nokia asha series which is about the same price.   There are phone which has got 3g connectivity at this price point. I dont recommend this phone as the Firefox OS installed in this phone is experimental.
1232	osman	Sep 08, 2014	Yes	low ram & batteries	this phone has only 126 mb ram & stucked @ using online aaplications any one want to buy this mobile please check andriod mobiles @ this price
1233	Nick the spinner	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Gud Buy	I received the Intex phone as how it was mentioned. I can see that the battery is running out in like 6 hrs, though I have charged for 8 to 10 hrs initially and I have spoken for about half an hour total time on the first day. Still, it's a gud buy for this price.
1234	Intex	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Incomplete Smartphone	Doesn't work without memory card. Poor Battery life. Application like Whtzapp is not working. So, without memory card, additional battery or power bank, and separate mobile for whtzapp it's not worth for this price also. If you are looking for double sim phone with good colours and internet connectivity, wifi enabled, hotspot, good sound, then go for it.
1235	Amit	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Awesome purchase at this price	This is awesome..easy to connect with whatsapp through connecta2...base touch screen phone...good as a standby phone....at this price an awesome deal
1236	N R DHORAIRAJU	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	INTEX CLOUD FX MOBILE	GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY
1237	Naveen	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Heck terrible! What was i thinking!	This is the worst phone I could have bought! Bought the phone solely to try out firefox OS which is terribly slow in processing any apps. Has already hung once while taking photos. I'm keeping the phone on charge for close to 14 hours. And if I were to attend a call and speak for 20 minutes, poof! 40% battery gone! At night when I keep the phone idly next to me with cellular data off with wifi on and fully charged, next morning the phone's running on battery saver mode with less than 10% remaining. Only the in-pack earphones are best suited to use with this phone. If I am to use any other earphones, the volume is at its feeblest level possible. Video recording is nowhere close to ok. What was I thinking! There isn't a single positive comment that I could add to this phone. Reeeaaallllyyy disappointed :(  Wish I could return this product!
1238	Viswam	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Battery Life is Pathetic	Battery life does not even hold one day. Quality of the product is extremely BAD.
1239	Madz	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	good Os but can be improved	Intexmobile.in is non responsive,,, m unable to find drivers to connect it to my system... other than that mobile is verygood in this price range,,, basic functions works good
1240	Mohsin	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Great responsive and execution is good.	Perfect
1241	Krishnakumar G	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	Very slow performance, Poor battery back	I need to take a powerbank also along with the phone to make continuous calls.  The battery back up is very very poor.  Touch quality also is not good.
1242	RAVINDRA	Sep 07, 2014	Yes	INTEX CLOUD FX	ITS LOOKING GOOD & BATTERY BACKUP IS LOW BUT CLARITY OK
1243	Raju	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	nic phone	excellent
1244	Rajat	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	Limited Features	Cheap Phone, which does not show on the build quality. However this Smart phone has no usb drivers. Intexmobile does not have any reference to this phone in their customer support section. Without USB drivers any smartphone is useless as you cannot load contacts. Intex should beef up their support for the phone before such a launch.
1245	ROHIT	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	RUPEES WASTE PHONE.	DONT BUY ANYONE THIS PHONE.THIS PHONE DON'T HAVE FEATURES.PROCESS IS VERY SLOW.BATTERY IS VERY FAST EMPTY .
1246	Sanket	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	Best @ Price But Slow for generation	Guyzz its in my hand now really good if u compare with price but now a days we are very fast and want better so cant say it is the best but intex could have did this operating system with quad core processor and 2 gb ram for around 8k that would had really helpfull to use this firefox OS
1247	cherry	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	Battery problem araised	we dont want this we want replace it...,
1248	hasan	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	not good	the product which sent by you is very slow in process for opening of each software it takes long time after clicking images by the use of camera ,  the flash sound comes after two minutes battery is very weak  totally this product is very slow in process not at all useful for me
1249	Rakesh	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	Poorest battery performance	This phone is good if you have battery charger connected all the time, continuously.
1250	rishabh	Sep 05, 2014	No	i need replacement	the os is very well build.... but sometimes when using the phone some pop sound comes from inside.... when listening music or even playing small games the battery gets over in a hour or so.... when using net some times the phone hangs and grey screen comes.... touch stopes responding and them i have to remove battery to restart the phone.....  please give me a replacement for the same phone.
1251	TANVEER	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	ok ok phn	dual sim is working bt wen any calls cms v cnt identify frm which sim its cmin and den aft seems to be slow phn while using the internet...........theres no watsapp fnd evn through a2 ,liquiod,open wapp...i couldnt use it....n battery is draining sooooo fasst...............even when i m nt using internet
1252	mahi	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	Nice Product	within limited budget it's a nice smart experience.. and special thanks to snapdeal for successful order..
1253	Anees	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Perfect for its Cost	Dear All, When you compare the features of mobile you need to compare it with the equal cost products not with high end products. In this cost, its a perfect product and i belive as this is intial version of Firefox OS, Whatsup team will develop supporting version for this mobile.
1254	Rajvi	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	What else do you need @ 2K!	Mozilla parterned with Firefox to bring this first Firefox OS phone to India. Firefox have a mission with Firefox OS ie, to connect the whole world, that's absolutely true, once you power on the device. This is clearly a phone for first time smart phone users & for power users who want to try something new & exciting. Although, Firefox OS is not matured as Android, yet it does score some brownie points over clean & unclutter interface. Many WebApps as excepted only launches mobile version of the site requested. No store registration is require dto download applications.  It can't get any better at 2K. It fall slightly short as a smart phon, however this is a definately a hight end feature phone. Buy if you can to ticker with Forefox OS or gift it to your maid, she may like it :)
1255	sirus	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Awesome Firefox ;)	The best product with unbeiveable price. This is a product for common people. Impressive, Touch is good , phone is very simple and easy to use. Dont think go for it.... value for money
1256	kashyap	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	not good	very bad
1257	Rimjhim	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Battery back up is very poor	Battery back up and RAM is very poor. It needs to charge twice in a day. Otherwise nice smart phone at this price.
1258	Mukesh Singhvi	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	1st experience with FIREFOX OS	with a lot of hope i opened the parcel and switched on the cell phone, so it is displaying Firefox OS after that and nothing is happening, i mean it is not even booted once :(...very unhappy with such product...written to SD for resolving it...let us hope they refund me amount and take back the item....I suggest dont ever OPT for this product at all.
1259	nagm	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Budget Phone but not impressive.	need so many improvements in OS, RAM & ROM. if you have curiosity to know about Firefox OS then go for it. otherwise wait for some time until available upgrade version.
1260	cim67	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Good!	Well at this price id say its a good phone! My only concern is why can't one use both the sims(you have to choose one sim at a time) at same time! Afterall, its a dual sim phone!
1261	Abmas	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Good for new smart phone users	need help music player is not working can any one give a advice
1262	Nikunj	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	~Welcome, Firefox OS!~	This mobile phone can act like a little-detox in this highly connected world. I bought this phone because I want to support Firefox OS. I am using it full time now. Now I can get on a bus without worrying about losing my phone :P  Pros: Smartphone for this price is just unbelievable. Phone is light weight and feels sturdy.  Cons: 1) No proximity sensors - it doesn't automatically glow once you move it away from your ear. You need to explicitly press the power button to wake it up. 2) No back button - remember the iPhone way? There is only one button. Press to go to the home. Long press for recent apps. Some people may find that funny :) but it's perfectly OK! 3) Power button isn't very responsive. Sometimes even after pressing it, the screen may not turn on. Maybe it goes into a deep sleep (to save battery?). 4) It hangs at times when you do something strange - maybe something resource intensive. And all you can do is wait for a couple of minutes and it comes back. Only once I got impatient to remove the battery and reboot. 5) Battery isn't very good. It can last a day only if you aren't looking at it all day. 4 hours of talk time may be a bit of exaggeration. 6) RAM is low - and hence when you come back to an application, its state may already be gone.  7) The Receiver volume is not up to the mark. Speaker volume is good.  Best Uses: /Notes:  SIM: It requires a regular SIM. So I got a jacket for my Micro SIM.  Instant Messaging: I love the fact that Whatsapp isn't officially available. Though you can use *ConnectA2* app to connect to Whatsapp which comes bundled with the device.  Messaging: The regular messaging works just fine. No emoji support as of yet.  Contact Sync: There are multiple ways to import contacts. I have tried: a) from Gmail (even the dp comes; I am not very sure if the new contacts will sync back to the cloud). b) from Facebook. c) from SD card (you can export all contacts on your Android phone and bluetooth to this phone .vcf)  Internet: Firefox is one of the best browsers out there. The websites are responsive but for some reason they don't look very good. Edge (2G) is working fine. There is no 3G support.  Configurations: Coming from Android - it would seem strange when you click on that sprocket & check out the settings menu. Nothing much to be configured there.  Responsiveness: I cannot compare it with my Nexus 4 but for all practical purposes it's more responsive than a low end Samsung device.  Themes: I guess they will eventually come.  Keyboard/Layouts: It comes with a QWERTY Keyboard and does a decent job at that. Other keyboard layouts: Colemak, Dvorak aren't available as of now. SOB! SOB!  App Store/Market Place: Firefox market place is rich. We all must make some valuable contributions to it. I installed the *Notes* app from Mozilla.  While browsing, you can add any website of your choice to your home screen and it's almost as good as having an app (think: favorites).  Games: I installed *Cut the Rope* from the MarketPlace but that didn't work at all. I could only hear the music. 2048 is pre-bundled and works just great.  Screenshot: You can take screenshots by pressing the Power Button and the Home Button together.  Internal Memory: is too low but you can put in an SD Card (upto 4GB) and it readily scans for all the music and pictures you have in there.  Reset/Update phone: You can reset the phone with just a click. App Updates are pushed by Market Place. Phone updates must cover Over the Air (OTA).  File Explorer: Works great. And you can practically do any kind of operations on the files (move/delete etc?).  Gallery: Shows you all the pictures by categorizing them on the picture-taken-date. You can even edit/transform your pictures from here.  Camera: Takes pictures. Period! (Please don't expect much out of this 2-megapixel camera)  Facebook: Application works pretty fast.  Email: Good!
1263	Chandan	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	garbage mobile by intex	Dont waste your money. cause: 1.USSD not supported so that you cant check blance 2.file manager doesnt open any file 3.one hour battery backup with running call and net 4.wifi does not work at all.
1264	Sunil	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Weak Battery	All the other positives get neutralised with the weak battery.
1265	JP	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	NO whats app though using connectA2	No whats app tried number of times showing error.
1266	kabir	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	awsome	awsom to good
1267	mannu	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	INTEX CLOUD FX	hello...sir me munishkoundal gudmorning all snapdeal members...sir we have purchage intex cloud fx mobile noe month ago so sir phone is so good per is battery very poor& not good.. so sir battery my opion is 10% marks
1268	Dr surya	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	worth for the cost	100% times better in its category I will recomend to one and all.
1269	Mumbaikaar	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Button on the top not working	the phone is turning off an  i cannot turn it on via the button on the top. have to plug in charge/remove battery
1270	BK	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	Worth the Money	Let me make it crisp by shooting out point by point. UI is Simple and Perfect. Colourfull looks is another advantage since we all love colours. OS which is first of its kind makes the owners feel great that they have something different from other users. Multitasking is working fine without much delay. Jawdropping Price. Earphone is fine. Normal weight. Size is pretty much handy and compact. Battery Backup is good when compared to other smart mobiles. Look and feel is good. The basic Social Networking apps which youngsters these days prefer are working fine including WhatsApp which works with a third party support. Internet and file sharing is fast and easy to use. Camera is somewhat better. Price is affordable which makes all the basic model mobile companies to rethink their statergy. The only concern is RAM which is considered way less these days. And still some areas like Caller tone which does not have any option for the users to set their own ringtone can be improved. In Overall, I suggest that you can go for this product if u want to enjoy the smartphone status in low cost and the same time no drought in experience that you get in any other smart mobiles.
1271	Surya	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	More Value for money	Fantastic  it is very beautiful phone at very low price. initially i had problem. i could not change the ring tone. The ringtone selection was not working.  i converted some mp3 ring tones to ogg format and copied to memory card. installed the ringtone picker app. now it is working perfectly. The file manager was not showing anything. i uninstalled that and reinstalled from marketplace. while installing it asked permission to access memory card. allowed  ( ofcourse it dis not strike to me.. i could have rectified this problem in app permissions in the settings menu i think.. ). now every thing works perfect. gmail and G+ you will not be able to login unless you change the security settings in google to allow less secure apps. Rest all the apps works as expected.  Really amazing performance at this low price
1272	svrkarthik	Sep 03, 2014	Yes	A new class of Smartphones	I have just bought this phone from Snapdeal and here are my observations of the phone 1.Good looks and decent build quality 2.The Firefox OS looks beautiful and the screen brings out the colours well.  3.The OS has great sync capabilities with Google, Microsoft and Facebook accounts 4.All basic apps such as Facebook, Youtube are preinstalled 5.The navigation is quite smooth and does the job quite well 6. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are upto the mark 7. The phone is solid and even survived a 5 foot drop onto the floor 8. The default Email app syncs seamlessly with all Email providers :) No need of separate apps 9. The battery is OK and should last atleast 10 hours on medium usage (with WiFi turned on) 10. Videos play smoothly and speaker sound is decent, so is headphone sound quality 11.Camera is very mediocre. 12.Inbuilt storage is very less. You'll  need a SD card 13.Notifications, settings and menus are easily accessible and work pretty well  Overall, I'd say its a great buy at this price range. About Firefox OS,its smart, beautiful and simple. It is a trendsetter in many aspects and it'll only keep getting better in the times to come with a burgeoning developer community knocking at its doors.
1273	Ramananda	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	Its a decent phone with this budget	Phone is working good.No lags like my samsung galaxy star.It's my first phone with an different OS(Firfox Os).  Pros: Screen size and quality is  decent and touch is awesome. Camera OK,Installation of apps/games is very fast.very less memory apps(Though they are HTML5 App).It was written 4GB of support but 8GB is working seamless.Bulid quality is Good.  Cons:Battery backup is poor as it has gone only 6hr with wi-fi video streaming and browsing.Apps having lots of adds. device lags on playing with decent-apps(fruit-cut ninja). Earphones not up-to mark(as cost matters).facebook app is like browsing facebook in opera-mini.   Overally its a good phone for the newbie.after all its an entry level phone you cannot aspect more with this price. I am happy with my step to open-web.As apps can be developed with HTML5,css,JS you can develop on your own (FOR developers).
1274	kulwinder singh	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	intex	great handset
1275	Prabhakar Gundlapalli	Sep 01, 2014	No	Outdated Specs	3.5" screen, 256MB internal memory with 45MB user memory, 2MP camera are outdated already. Exapndable memory to 4GB only. Difficult to find such micro SD cards. India is moving with 8, 16 and 32 GB memory cards. How about apps for Firefox OS ? Think twice before buying this gadget.
1276	Chintu	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	Good phone...	Overall nice budget phone... looking stylish, OS interface is good... options are all just like android... Whats app supports via third party app but running a bit slow.. It has a App store...(you can see some of famous apps such as fruit ninja, cut the rope etc..) camera quality not up to the mark... Touch responce is pretty Good.. Internet surfing is also good(video streaming too).. but sometimes hangs.. may because of Low RAM...  Overall Good for normal use...for normal people...
1277	120404	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	Good budget phone	Pros: camera is good. Worth for money  Cons: Loud speaker is bad
1278	Gowtham	Sep 01, 2014	No	NICE but need FEATURES like 3G & GPS	Nice Mobile but need 2 add features like 3G,AGPS with some price Hike may be 500 ,i would recommend 2 friends if it has the above said features
1279	mathew	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	It seems waste of investment	Wifi is not working. If any phone comes display off. touch is pathetic, never advice any one to buy this one.
1280	Accompanier	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	Can't wait to have hands-on experience..	Have been eagerly waiting for the phone with firefox OS as it has been in news since last 4-5 months. Intex grabbed the opportunity to be the pioneer (Spice yet to be launched here on Snapdeal). The features provided in this price range seems to be fine to begin with; once the users get their hands-on experience, their reviews after use would certainly bring more such products with revised and additional features!  Just placed an order for two pieces and expecting to receive it in a week as promised on web-site. After discussions with friends, have already recommended it and as mentioned here before, my friend shall have the other piece :) Also waiting for the Spice model and would buy it too!  Of course, the next review will be about the experience using Intex's firefox followed by Spice's (I guess Snapdeal must have made Spice to wait ;) It reminds of well-known banner movies waiting to be released one after another with considerable time-gap in between so that they won't eat out each other's market-share..  By then, if any patron has already received this product & have started using it, those 'real product user reviews' are welcome. For now I would conclude noting the immediate pros & cons of the product Intex Cloud FX (based on the critical analysis of its promotional information): Pros : this product seems to have a user friendly interface, simple to use esp. for senior citizens (I plan to gift it to the elderly family members)! Stating Cons right now right here is not apt. Rather I would put it as an area for improvement.. I wish like Spice, Intex too could have provided front cam.. This is the only additional feature (along with provision of added Indian languages, larger battery, etc) I got to see in the other product.  PS: those 3-stars are for the pioneering efforts of both Snapdeal and Firefox OS. Hmmm, so till next few days, we can wait and watch…
1281	Uzairusty	Sep 01, 2014	Yes	The Best product available at this Range	First impressions: *Easy to use Interface *Good 2.5G speed. *Good Quality. *Good Marketplace(less but useful apps) A perfect Entry level smartphone.
1282	ASD the MBBS Hacker	Sep 01, 2014	No	First Mover Advantage	Pros: This is the first phone in Indian market with Firefox OS preloaded!  If you're looking for a smartphone, and your budget is less than 5000, do not go for low-end local android smartphones, instead go for this ultra-cheap FirefoxOS phone   Don't be under the impression that the 1GHz CPU and 128MB RAM are too less. It's FirefoxOS, not android. And it'll run on your bread toaster.  You might find the third party WhatsApp support a bit buggy. But if you're really interested in secure communication, you should be using Telegram Messenger.  Only real cons: 2MP Camera - if camera matters for you No 3G support - if you aren't in a WiFi network almost all the time.  Disclaimer: I am a Mozilla volunteer, and I haven't bought this phone personally.
1283	sandy	Aug 28, 2014	No	AWESOME PIECE	good stuff in cheap price
1284	Akki42	Aug 28, 2014	No	Great phone great price	Pros: cheap , value for money, good performance. Cons: none. good as a secondary phone and for people who may use online services . this is a device which must not be compared with higher end devices and snapdeal has done a great job bringing it at an excellent price.
1285	Harsh	Aug 28, 2014	Yes	Value for Money and a different OS Taste	Overall the smartphone looks good enough and for such a small price, you do get a decent package.The hardware limitation does hamper the experience as you don't get 3G and the low-quality touchscreen does not offer the best response,it gives a similar experience as Nokia's Asha OS.
1286	Pindi	Aug 28, 2014	No	Dynamic phone at a affordable price.	Useful features. Social media apps, easy to use and at a very affordable price!

1293	PRAVEEN K	Aug 25, 2014	No	NOT ENOUGH RAM..	OVER ALL AMAZING PRODUCT IN THIS BUDGET, BUT RAM IS ONLY 128 MB IF YOU DOWNLOAD JUST 2 APPS YOUR PHONE WILL START HANGING
1294	Saswat	Aug 25, 2014	No	Fine pricing but low RAM and battery	RAM should have been atleast 256MB. 128MB of RAM wont do any good these days. And had the resolution been a bit more along with the battery, it would have made a much better buy. Anyways, this is still a good budget smartphone.
1295	saurabh shabdik	Aug 25, 2014	No	Superb Smartphone in lowest price.	Awesome I want it!  The user interface resembles iOS and some custom Android interfaces. Firefox OS is the future of smartphone OS.The main target of Firefox OS is developing markets. The first devices run on relatively low-end hardware, which is surprisingly affordable.  The phone is compact and is not very heavy. Made of plastic, the phone feels solid and durable, and there were no creaks and wobbles even though it features a removable back cover.
