73	KISHORE	Sep 28, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. The brand Apple is one of the reputed brand and no other smartfone can be compared with this.

394	Annie	Jun 03, 2015	Yes	Value for money in it's price range	i-Phone 4S in it's price range is definitely value for money cos of it's brand value,great look, amazing display, fast touch, quality of headphone and few smart apps installed inside.  Party freaks, travelers and businessmen may not find this as a great Personal Digital Assistant(PDA)as the battery back up is poor and they can't for longer without plugging in charger.  Apart from brand loyals i think this is worthy investment in this price range.

437	Redocrac	May 28, 2015	Yes	ios is awesum.....	As a phone lover rather OS lover its been a tremendous experience to use ios, although i have used android, windows, rim but the kindaa experience ios gave me is remarkable. The speed is unmatched. This phone is still much better than any of the mid range android. It doesn't stick or hang. The most awesum thing i found is the number of apps u can open simultaneously, which is restricted in others like in blackberry u can open only 8 apps at most. Camera quality still beats many of the hi fi phones having bulky configuration. None of the app can slow it down infact i played asphalt 8 and temple run without havin any slowing down issue like in android and rim(blackberry). There are many other awesum experience which cant be matched. The only problem with this phone is transfering data although it is not difficult for professionals bt yeah for common man its challenging. At last if u r in amood to buy cheap and robust phone go for it bcoz it still can beat many of the modern phones. .... Hats off to mr. Steve Jobs for making this wonderful phone.....

578	sumit priyadarshi	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	Phone to flaunt n please !	At jaw dropping discounted price, this iconic cellphone is eye candy for many. It has an unmatched ability to catch the signal and offers best in class audibility, be it lifts, while travelling or in the basement etc. The touch control is unmatched, as if the phone knows what you want to pick from screen in the display. It learns your figure gestures and adapts accordingly. The phone performs well on WiFi data but lasts not so longer on 3G data over mobile.. however, most of us use WiFi, so that's not a deal breaker.... The screen resolution is very good and the focusing ability of camera is pleasing experience as well, even during low light flash assisted usage. Almost all of the popular applications are available on App Store. The other best part is the crystal clear and lossless performance when it is used as ipod, in that case the battery also lasts longer...so its a good gadget to use in the flight... Verdict---GO FOR IT before its gone out of stock....on snapdeal only where else....
579	Ashu	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	i like it	Not much to say its iphone yaar... like the camera and keypad most. But the only con is the battary, which is comon in nowdays phones (not so big that u can't survive) . So if are interested in it go for it..

CONS- 1 No direct access to the inbuilt memory on connecting with PC. Apart from that I am quiet happy with the iphone 4s and the service experience provided by snapdeal.com,thanks and keep it up.
588	Kapil	Apr 20, 2015	Yes	Apple iPhone	I first time buought Apple iPhone. It's look is very charming & slim. It give a great impression in front of others. When we open any website on it, We can easily read the content of it, which was not in the my earlier mobiles. The big drawback of this phone is Non compatibility with other mobiles, as we can not transfer data, songes etc in it from other company mobiles.
589	IFan	Apr 20, 2015	Yes	I got an "IDeal" or mere 'Dil ki Deal'	There are so many reasons I am calling this purchase an "IDeal".  I have been looking to buy a smartphone for a long time. There were always too many choices, too many brands and by the time you decide, there is a new model in the market.  Finally, I did some product research and zeroed in on a brand (Apple) and then compared features on Snapdeal for various Iphone models. Once I did that I realized that since I am not going to stream hi-def videos on my Iphone or use much of the processing power of the smartphone, I should buy a model which is convenient to carry (i.e. not too big), is light weight relatively. Therefore, I picked Iphone 4S which has basically all the features of the advanced models with somewhat lower specs which are not important to me.   4S is not the latest model therefore the discounts are awesome, shipping time is less and you still get the best branded smartphone.   Last but not least- I compared prices on other shopping sites as well, but I got the lowest price on Snapdeal.  Now if this is not IDeal, then what is? :) Thanks Snapdeal for a wonderful shopping experience.

661	Shyjith M	Feb 20, 2015	Yes	Fantastic Phone	I like this phone very much. This is not my first phone. But something there in this phone which attracted me. I ordered this phone on 6th and i got it on 13th. Means just one week. Awsome packing. So i give full marks to snapdeal for such care they taken.  And about the product. Anyway its apple. So there will be something attractive always.  I am reviewing this by what i feel:  Pros:  1. Amazing Display clarity.  2. Amazing picture and video clarity 3. Full HD with 1920x1080 4. Good sound clarity 5. Support most of the video and audio files 6. 8MP Camera with LED flash 7. Stylish Design  8. Good touch response 9. Retina Display 10. Finger print scanner and Siri..  Cons:  1. Front camera is just .3MP - But good quality 2. No FM Radio- Negative 3. Battery is not removable- But its 1420MaH. So no problem. It will last longer 4. NO HDMI port- Negative 5. No Memory card support- Its just 8GB memory. In current days life its bit low. :) 6. RAM is just 512 MB- But runs most of the applications 7. Processor is just 1GHZ- But never stucks any process.  8. Just 3.5" Display size- Bit low for video playing and gaming.  Overall i will give full marks to this phone. "NO FM radio" is the main Draw back of this phone. All other cons are just for review only. Most of us not using HDMI port. So its not all a  problem.   Now a days apple gone so far from iphone 4s. But still i suggest this phone to all. A money worth phone for below 20K from apple family.   NB: This is just my personal opinion only.

677	Guest	Feb 15, 2015	Yes	First IPhone and Best Deal to get one !!	This was my first IPhone and I should say best decision of my life of switching from Andriod to IOS. Have been using Note 2 for 2 and half years and was happy, but planned to switch to IOS and I guess my decision is the best one. Extremely smooth and fast, u don't find the lag at all using multiple applications. Camera is just awesome. Battery drains little faster, but the charging is equally quick. Overall the best decision. the seller was out of stock, but I got the product exactly after one week of placing the order and I guess it was still a good time. Overall a great phone at great deal.
678	Gurveen	Feb 15, 2015	Yes	Best phone ever	After having terrible experience with Samsung Android phones, I went ahead to buy apple this time. I am happy that I took a right decision. It is too good in terms of quick response, clarity and easy to use. Awesome experience
679	Vaibhav	Feb 15, 2015	Yes	Fabulous	Easy to use and handle with Good detailed finish recommended
680	Ravi	Feb 15, 2015	Yes	Faster delivery & a genuine iphone 4s	It has been 1 week of use and till date no problem. First about seller : Very good & delivered within 2 days. I have seen reviews saying that they received a faulty/used product but in my case I was lucky & received a genuine iphone 4s. The moment I unpacked the product, first i went to the website of Apple & checked the warranty of the product with the serial no. of product. It indicated that iphone is not activated yet, means a genuine product & being used 1st time. Packing was also very good. Phone was having ios 7.1and was manufactured in sep 2014. About the phone : Battery life & camera is very average. But soud & display is awesome. Look, touch & feel is very satisfying. So if u buying for camera, then it is not for u.. Sound quality with the headphone(included in box) is just stunning. For my usage, it is very nice. Totally satisfied with Snapdeal & seller, no issues at all.

697	dr	Jan 20, 2015	Yes	DEAL MADE WITH SNAP OF AN EYE.	First of all this is my second awesome experience. I am already a user of Iphone 4S since 2 years and just made an excellent deal once more for my family to enjoy this phone. PROS:The best deal amongst all the iphones presently with almost nearly 60% discount on its price, compared to others. Once you are an iphone user believe me you would never look  back for any others.  CONS:It would have been better if it had an extendable memory and better battery backup when using internet, these  should be looked upon by apple in future.  In short i would like to say buy this iphone from snap of your eye, and savour the moment.
698	Sumit	Jan 20, 2015	Yes	awesome discount with timely deliver	This is my first shoping with snapdeal and i was really very impressed with their awesome discount delivery status and coordination.

732	RAHUL MAURYA	Nov 10, 2014	No	That's Good Stuff	A nice Phone
733	Pramod Malik	Nov 10, 2014	No	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Apple has the most reliable Hardware.   Its a breath of fresh air after a nightmarish experience with Samsung S4 mini.  Never in life I am going to buy any Samsung phone, their Hardware is rubbish, S4 Mini, was getting hot with in  15 days and then only one of the two sims was able to catch network while both the sims were from the same service provider isn't that bizarre and frustrating ? After getting it repaired from their service center twice and even after change of mother board nothing changed. Had to go through hassle of managing complete data loss and its recovery twice because of the repairs which Samsung doesn't do it for you (I strongly feel they should do it as it is required because of their hardware failure)  On the other hand i Phone 4S is a very reliable and consistent phone. Battery is a humble one yet the hardware of phone is such that it consumes nominal battery and it lasts the complete day. Voice quality is outstanding. It is as clear as a Land-line phone and speakers are crustal clear and reasonably Loud too. Body is little heavy because of use of Aluminium but that's what makes it a long lasting phone.  Apple's OS is very reliable yet most of the apps you download are to be paid for where as android based apps are mostly free. If you need lot of music etc on phone it has a limited memory of 8GB.   15 TO 18000 price is too attractive.

758	Sutanu	Oct 29, 2014	Yes	Review from a migrated user of iPhone	This review is basically on the product, and not the online service availed.  I have been an Android & Blackberry user, throughout my smartphone era. This is the first time I am using an iPhone and I would like to share my views, as a first time iPhone user from India.  The first impression is looks, and no doubt, its spot on. Holding an iPhone in your hand is altogether a different experience from whatever phones I have been using till date (Nokia,Blackberry,Samsung). Its a premium feeling. Same reaction evokes with the touch screen manoeuvrability, and to me it felt better than anything I have used till date in this range.  I started using the phone. Now, I am not much of a fancy user and my usage is primarily for calling, texting, email, photo capture, facebook, whatsapp. Since I do not have 3g enabled, so the online activities is limited to availability of Wifi access in my office.  My first feedback from using an iPhone is that, it suffocates me! I feel iPhone limits a user to certain features, missing out on some which are readily available in other phones. Let me try to point a few:  1. All files have to synced from desktops using iTunes, which is available for Windows & Mac, but not for say Ubuntu or neither does it support natively. 2. Text messages do not show a delivery report.  3. Not all text messages show timestamp. 4. No scrolling to top/bottom feature in message inbox. 5. No native file manager explorer. 6. File atributes, size/timestamp etc not displayed 7. Settings/control panel functions limited. Like, not able to view transient/current running apps and swapping 8. UI is not very intuitive. Still not able to share a photo with bluetooth. 9. No simple touch present for rejecting an incoming call.  It seems to me that Apple always have the American customer in mind while designing. Appealling look and feel, with defined and limited functionality. Do as you are told and dont try to be smarter. Being an informed user, iPhone cripples me and sadly I am thinking of going back to Android, or more preferably to Blackberry.  I would suggest people who use Android/Blackberry or maybe even Windows phone(I haven't used one), try out an iPhone first before you buy it. The un-ease of use, is a big let down for me and I feel I did a mistake by switching to iPhone. Well, that's totally my personal call!  Pls note this review is based on my experience with 4S, as that is what suits my budget.

790	RTS	Oct 01, 2014	Yes	Excellent	IOS8 for iphone 4s is a nightmare.Battery life is pathetic and also it is not as smooth as it was on ios 7.1.2. Also in iphone 4s 8 gb model if u install this ios8 u will be only left with 4.9 GB of storage!!! so its a real trade off if u want some apps like healthkit etc and want ur 4s battry backup to be reduced to only 5-6 hours then u can go ahead and enjoy. Super experiance by snapdeal.

844	tirth	Aug 10, 2014	Yes	nice mobile	hey guys . i just want to tell about my experience about this phone IPHONE 4S i have been using this phone and here's my review PROS superb camera quality  awesome display (retina display) is just too good) Ios no doubt is the best no lags whatsoever running 7.1.2 flawlessly  awesomme BUILT quality sound quality also good  CONS  small screen size(if you dont want a bulky phone and want a good phone 4s is the best) battery backup isnt that great in 3G network barely a day but in 2g full day   overall if you dont have a iphone you dont have one  i am very happy with my phone , i have used a lot of android phones in my life but Iphone is iphone but comparison , at first i never liked iphone because of overprice but now i understand why its price is high , yes they give you value of money . so steal it  yes if you want a big screen phone with a lot cooler features go for HTC desire 816 or if you want a good phone at this segment 4S is the best Thank you
845	Goofy	Aug 10, 2014	Yes	Perfect phone for Gen X!!!	At around 21k this is an ideal phone from the Apple stable. The camera, email, music facility is all perfect. It's basically a perfect gadget to be with you for all your electronic needs. Sell your old one at OLX to get the best price and buy this one. I sold my samsung tablet to buy this. So the price comes down by another 8-10k and the resultant is a phone around 10-12k. Moreover this phone commands a good price at the time of selling it. All in all a must phone and the best place to buy - Snapdeal!

864	Andy R M	May 14, 2014	Yes	A Complete Phone	Not being an apple fanboy I ve resisted this brand just because of its price range. But lately they have slashed      the prices of iphone 4 & 4s which made me go for it. Its been two weeks now i am using iPhone 4s and i am quite satisfied with it. Pros: Built Quality & looks iOS 6 & 7 are the best mobile platforms Camera is awesome.  Battery Backup is good too. Retina Display & touch quality is excellent. Apple A5 chip (Processor)  Note: 4s comes with 512MB ram, but ios memory management is so good that you'll never fall short of memory.
865	Kapil Ramnani	May 14, 2014	Yes	Iphone4s is awesome	iPhone 4s is awesome. Cannot compare iPone products with any other brand. I simply love iphone..   I have bought 5-6 mobile handset with overall good experience but little problem with one handset iPhone4s 8gb which was pre-owned/pre-activated. Otherwise shopping at snapdeal is a good experience. Keep it up and try to avoid such incidents with everyone in future
866	Vini Bharadwaj	May 14, 2014	Yes	The Best I Phone Ever...	This is My First I Phone..And I m very Happy with this.. Got in 4 days,after i buy from snapdeal...thank you snapdeal..
