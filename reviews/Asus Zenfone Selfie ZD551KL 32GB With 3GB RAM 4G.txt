14	Nabendu	Jan 19, 2016	Yes	Asus Zenfone Selfie - A Budget phone for speedy users	My first asus zenfone selfie which I ordered was a defective one and got a heating issue on simple surfing through apps. I returned it within 7 days and the replacement was delivered after 9 days it got shipped. I would like to thank snapdeal team for coordination and regular update and enquiry for getting it delivered after 9 days long time span due to operational issues of xpressbees courier.  Though the second delivery made me frustrated but a big thanks to snapdeal for providing the replacement at 2K additional cost from which I placed my actual order (Snapdeal adjusted that extra amount from its pocket). In one word, its an awesome phone with budget price. Only problem is battery quality. Otherwise it's very good to have this smartphone. I will check it for next couple of days and hope this time luck will be with me.
15	emailprd1	Jan 19, 2016	Yes	Super awesome! !	Wonderful phone. One of its best in this segment. I was confused between one plus one, one plus two and nexus 5x. Bit using this product made it clear that it was value fr money. Snapdeal usually takes 4-7  days fr delivery but this time it reached in 3 days.  Battery goes well with standard usage and optimal settings with 4G/3G for one day. Camera quality and sound is awesome. I got confused when I saw reviews of some ppl.
