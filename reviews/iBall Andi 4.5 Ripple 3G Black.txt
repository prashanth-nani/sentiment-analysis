4	bhola	Oct 15, 2015	Yes	awesome	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device.  Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice  display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite  heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really  buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer  similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this.  If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting  for other brands. By Amar from, d
