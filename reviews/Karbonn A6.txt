3	ankitsinghbhadouria	Jun 16, 2015	Yes	In this price it was a deal.	A average smartphone in tbe price range of 4000 bucks. But if you want to buy a smartphone today in the range of 4 to 5k Then you we find a plenty of other options.  Good but not up to mark.

40	Dave Jpaul	Jun 18, 2013	Yes	karbonn A6	The phone looks good but surely you get what u pay for. As compared to similar looking phones by Samsung or Sony, you will notice that the quality is not at pat with such manufactures. The screen response is slow, sound does not have clarity,  It sure is worth it for its price but don't expect a high end phone. The feature are good. You can find the same for little over Rs. 300 less. I found it within two days of buying. Unfortunately there is no price guarentee in india
41	Jprakashraja	Mar 23, 2013	Yes	suit to your budget	one of the best launch from karbonn. I got it yesterday, it satisfy my requirement.  Best budget phone to buy for 5400..
