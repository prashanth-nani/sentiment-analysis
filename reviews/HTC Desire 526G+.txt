342	Melvyn Antis	May 26, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	Nice phone for the price point. Nice front and back cam. Looks are great.  Two drawbacks which i found are:  1) Cant move app to SD card. 2) Back panel is glossy and it started to peel off from left side so i have to put cover, still when it rubs on the cover too it peels off.
343	sanjay	May 26, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone	Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is good, speaker not too loud,   Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

372	Mausam	May 21, 2015	Yes	Recommended only for new smart phone users	I bought this phone for my dad. Felt like a good phone to buy for the price and also the kind of usage he would made. It is more phone calls for him and very less data.  But still sometimes it hangs even when only very few apps are installed in this.  Battery is good, touch is good. speaker is not that loud and yes.. a little heavy to carry, also load minimum applications.  This phone is excellent for people switching from non-smart phone to smart phone and have a very limited use of smart phone features.   This phone is average for people who want to extensively use smartphone features.

Most of them deliver us cheap quality products and charge us more. If u have any doubt just compare the price and quality of the products they deliver in USA, Europe and in India. U will know the bitter truth. Even the laptop manufacturers are also doing the same.

504	Kanak	Apr 23, 2015	Yes	9,500.. Seriosuly ?	This is the first android device for my dad and I gifted him this. He is not into big screen phone as he finds it uncomfortable to use and carry around but I wanted to gift him a good phone, so I had to wait for this phone.  Positives: Such specifications in this price tag, that too by HTC. It is totally a steal deal. Having been into HTC for 6 years, I was waiting for this phone to launch. Fits perfectly, has radio which you can record. Expandable Memory and a decent camera quality. Not bad, for a starter or a regular usage when you are seeking a good phone in mid range. It is been 1 month and he is still using it and it works absolutely flawless.  Negatives : In this price tag, there ain't many.   Summary : If seeking for a decent phone with good specification in mid range it is completely a deal by HTC. Front and back camera quality is good. Does't lag, not heavy and works absolutely fantastic.

509	avinash	Apr 23, 2015	No	Simply not upto the mark!	After using Xolo 500s IPS for some months, i was in the need of upgrading my phone. What i was looking for was at least 1 GB RAM, 4-5" Screen, Decent camera and Good build quality with good performance. Handsets fulfilling these criteria were :- 1) Moto G 2) Lenovo A 6000 3) Red Mi Note 4G 4) HTC 526 G+ After checking some reviews and feedback, i zeroed onto HTC 526 G+ only because of BRAND NAME HTC!  Well...after buying i found this phone not up to expectations.   Pros- HTC Brand Name! (Pros ends here only)  Cons- 1) Low and dull speaker sound. Even with a good quality earphone the sound quality is dull. 2) Worst Build quality- Back panel skin of my phone started peeling off the next week itself! I had preferred this phone over lenovo and other phones like Xolo etc because of quality issues only but it seems with tagline "Quietly Brilliant" of HTC gone, the real quality has also gone for a toss. 3) Average display and resolution- Even my Xolo 500S IPS had a bright and clear resolution than this phone. 4) Lag- HTC is boasting of 1.7 GHz Octa-core processor but multitasking makes it to lag and one can really feel it. 5) HTC Sense- Nothing great about it. I am not biased towards HTC but the earlier UI which i had used in HTC Desire X was way better than the current one. It seems plane android. 6) Power button- It is at awkward position and just below the volume button. One will need sometime to adjust to this position and distinguish the gap between Volume & Power button. At a first sight of this phone, one of my friend even asked why there is 2 power button?  Rest other things are okay okay. Avg. Camera, Avg. Battery Back up, Average Look(But Lenovo A6000 and Red Mi Note looks much more stylish and cool than this phone)  Bottom line- Not up to the expectation. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. May be lenovo A Series, Red Mi, Moto G/X..but not this one!

529	MY BEST FRIEND	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	LOVE htc	This phone changed my personality due to its stunning slim looks with enhanced features and better simplicity . It has Google drive built in making it more technosavi phone the htc audio gives a better listening experience than any other phone making it a movable deck sort of. The phone of modern generation with future adaptations.Hats off
530	Manori	Apr 21, 2015	Yes	good product	Very good device as far as the price range is concerned...  this is my second HTC...former one was having beats audio inbuilt...so if you are already using a beats HTC..then music quality will slightly disappoint you...but for a first time user it will be good...liked it...  camera is also good..both for picture quality and capturing speed... battery is average...having some unnecessary installed apps..  so allover as a youngster,for photos,speed,and looks...it is worth for money
531	Devansh	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	Perfect for the moderate user!	I'm a student of Class 9th, and while concentrating on studies, I love to stay connected. With a very reasonable price tag, this phone satisfies me perfectly. Black is the recommended colour, because the white one the phone look small. It has a beautiful 4.7" display with great colours. The touch sensitivity is too good to be true. The front camera is great for general trips, and the front is good too, but its display angle isn't very wide. The front is perfect for the moderate selfie taker. But both the cameras get a little blurry if you zoom in on a taken picture too much.  It has two front speakers, but its a bit sad that only one is used while playing music. It is pretty comfortable to hold, and the premium look and feel of HTC is pleasurable. The battery charges very quickly, and can easily last you a day. Android Kitkat is awesome, and te phone has so far run very smoothly and hardly ever glitches. The HTC Sense UI is brilliant and unique, but Blinkfeed sadly never works for me. A decent range of preinstalled apps are available to kickstart your use. You can easily transfer data from your old phone and integrate all your social media accounts.  For the moderate user like me, who always stays connected and cool, playing simple time-pass games, while not obsessing over the phone too much, this phone is beyond perfect. Its specs are close to other phones of a higher price, so at this price its an awesome buy. In this country brimming with Samsung and Micromax mobiles, having an HTC, known for being premium, is totally epic. So if you want to stay cool and connected and not go over the top, this phone is highly recommended to all! Pros: More than decent camera, smooth performance, great interface and touch, along with a solid built and stylish design. Good enough internal memory for those with a good SD card, decent battery life and premium feel.  Cons: Blinkfeed did not work for me. Certain elements make it hard to organise your media. No NFC and few other features. few options in settings to keep things right.  Best Used for: A regular user looking for decency in all segments.
532	Vibhu Arora	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	great product at this price range..vgreat looks..ery nice battery backup..display is a little disappointing but at this price range that too from HTC is a steal deal.

537	Anand	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	quality	Good feature with affordable cost
538	Sinesh	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	Very good phone at such low price from h	A few of my friends were raving about the Zenfone from Asus. Great value, and the Zenfone is also catching on in Japan. As I was ready to buy the Zenfone this HTC 526G just arrived the day before, so it is the newest HTC phone, and the newest phone in town.  I couldn't help but notice how pretty this HTC phone is and the finish is luxurious. It looks like an upscale phone to me! There are two colors to choose from, one is glossy all black. I choose the white one with blue edge and the case looks like it has an expensive lacquer lol! The Zenfone is very nice but it's case with metallic paint does not feel as expensive. The Zenfone has a lot of satisfied customers and the photos in daylight are excellent.  The first 2 nights I charged it fully and for the next 2 days the battery seem to last barely a day. So I was pretty. They've got to cut the cost somewhere... I thought. However, after having the phone for 2 weeks I'm happy to report that the battery lasts forever! (well, not forever but you get the idea, perhaps 5 days with minimal use.)Admiring the time and energy you put into your website and in depth information you offer.

544	surry	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone	I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands
545	Akash	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	OMG its really very good	first snapdeal diliverd  it wintin 14 hours ifoubd that + points Very good camera, flash is very very power full Good mobile from htc at Very best price. wifi is very good better than soney m2 Touch is great, very fast and no lags Battery backup approx 2 Days with WiFi - points (but not a big deal) heat while playing high graphics game like asphalt 8 screen quality good (not hd but look good) Low speaker sound compare to chines phone(not very low )

549	Puviyarasan	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Good Phone with Good Feature!!!	I brought HTC Desire 526G+. I am using last one week. its good & Value for Money  Specification: 8 MP Primary Camera 2 MP Secondary Camera Dual Standby Sim (GSM + UMTS) Android v4.4 Kitkat OS  Screen: After seeing a lot of reviews thought that screen might disappoint, as in a review i found out it supports only 2 touch max, thought thats weird and might affect in responsiveness when multi touch. I let my faith in htc for their displays do the job, and hands on, the display is stunning, perfect color reproduction for the price or above, no issues at all, even in gaming.    Camera  Prim:8 and Sec:2 , does job superbly , especially back 8mp cam (no one will argue read reviews across web)   Go for it Guys, give it a try, I don't think its harmful !

600	krwish	Apr 02, 2015	Yes	A good deal to crack at 9999 or below.	It is responding quite well & obviously this budget phone is the best one under 10K. The only problem is that the voice quality is not that loud in speaker mode but is compromisable for phones in this range with these features.Only redmi Note provides better feature and quality than this but since it is unavailable so i would suggest to go for this. Another option is Micromax Yu Yureka but the processor gets heated up when multitasking which is a problem for me.

700	Saurabh	Mar 13, 2015	Yes	good phone with one problem	I purchased this phone in mid February, just after 2 weeks the paint on the back cover started falling. My friend purchased the same model (but 16GB variant).. he faced the same problem just after 1 week. It seems there is some manufacturing defect in this handset/model. The phone is otherwise good and functions well. Powered with decent battery. Another problem, I purchased the 8 GB model (bcz 16GB variant was not available at that time). I would suggest go for 16GB internal memory model. HTC does not even show 8GB model on their website.

715	parkash	Mar 10, 2015	Yes	I would buy this product again and agai	his is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)

719	MANOJ	Mar 10, 2015	Yes	I would buy this product again and again	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brand
720	karthik	Mar 10, 2015	Yes	good one	Nice no comments
721	vicky	Mar 09, 2015	Yes	good	not bad

730	Shivam Gupta	Mar 09, 2015	Yes	Great phone in a great price	It is a great phone to use in a great price. The features which are offered in this phone are available in phones which are 2000-3000 costlier than this phone. Its perfect in look, touch is awesome and camera quality is also good. One major drawback in this phone or all htc desire phones is that you don't have option to select only 2g in mobile network so it automatically switches from 3g to 2g which costs battery life upto a great extent and call drop is higher if you are travelling since in india at most places only 2g network is available so it keeps switching. Hence i recommend htc should provide 2g network only in its next update. Otherwise the phone is a great buy.
731	Bhanu	Mar 07, 2015	Yes	Nice mobile within the range	Nice mobile within the range  But the mobile was not worthy. Backdoor was very delicate it was not fit to the phone.   And main thing is not good for camera. It doesn't have 8mp. Its not worthy.
732	Ritesh Bhatia	Mar 07, 2015	Yes	awesome pefromance camera average,batter	Camera average,ba ter below average performance more than expected, no no app sd card option i will recommend only more gamers.
733	Sachin	Mar 07, 2015	Yes	Very satisfied with the product so far	Snapdeal delivered the phone in just couple of days so that was great.  The phone itself seems good so far ... it is just over a week so far. It was very easy to setup. The screen quality is great. The interface is very responsive ..  Overall, I am finding it an excellent buy for the price

739	TN	Mar 07, 2015	Yes	Satisfied with order overall	Satisfied with order overall. Only matter surprising me was that this dual GSM SIM phone allows 3G on one slot and the other is 2G. only. You can choose which slot will be 3G.
740	Raag....the melody	Mar 07, 2015	Yes	htc 526g+	the delevery of the product is very fast.and the handset is very light weight and flexible for carrying anywhere.internet access is very fast even though it is 2G.A very nice product by HTC people
741	HB singh	Mar 06, 2015	Yes	HTC 526 G+	This phone is excellent, good looking, and value for money. *****
742	Arun	Mar 06, 2015	Yes	Great phone..but not so great flow	Best advantage of the phone is the processor. Picture quality of good. Contains most of the features of high end phones. However, the only draw back is the flow of directions for executing common commands and operations ex. searching a contact, viewing log of calls or sharing business card. I fail to understand why they have made flow of command for such simple and frequently used functions so complicated! Still, value for money and will recommend‚Ä¶ Regards Arun

748	nicktom	Mar 06, 2015	Yes	Snappy htc phone with amazing camera	The mobile is a combo of performance as well as cool color contrast and it doesn't lag. The display is  quite brilliant, and the battery lasts for 1 day with average use of wifi and making calls. Its a bit bulky and the sound output is moderate. It charges to a full with the provided 1A charger in about 4- 4/5 hrs. It plays almost all the new HD games but becomes a little hot after sometime due to its mediatek processor.Both Htc sense and the blinkfeed are amazing. The camera quality of both the rear and front camera is outstanding.All Htc phones are fragile so handle them with care. Overall a nice phone in the price range

Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
846	Ankit	Feb 20, 2015	Yes	Best product	nice phone. i would say one of the best phone at this rate. no issues. phone is fast. no hanging issues. dual sim phone. the best part of the phone is 1GB RAm and 1.7 Ghz octa core processor which makes it the best phone at this range in the existing market. I rocommend this phone if some body is looking phone in this budget.      The above review is 100% true as i myself have used the phone and i had a great experience.           Thank You.

858	Selva	Feb 19, 2015	Yes	Decent budget phone from a premium brand	If you are looking for a phone within your budget and without cheap looks, go for it. It would not disappoint you. Touch sensitivity is good.HTC user interface is great. Octa core processor at this price, provides lag free experience. Camera and sound quality is great. Lack of gorilla glass is a drawback but considering a quality budget phone from a premium brand, it's quite understandable. The only disappointing thing is that the grip is not matte, and since any cases or covers are not available in the market as of now (Feb 18, 2015), it is quite risky to hold it.

882	Viji	Feb 14, 2015	Yes	HTC 526g+ decent phone	I ordered HTC526g+ 8GB from snapdeal. I had high exptectations about the mobile after reading general reviews about premiumness, solid build, reliablility of HTC devices.  This phone is budget quality at best and doesn't live up to my expectations atleast.  The back cover is not sitting into the device perfectly after removing it to place my SIM. There is slight looseness about the back cover.  My previous mobile LG l70 dual (4.1.2) had great inbuilt widgets like custom calender, direct dial which are not part of this mobile.  Even the accliamed HTC sense is not good and device appears more like stock android.  Performance is good and will not be an issue but when i played subway with couple of background tasks, there was a slight lag.  Only single color option (white with blue lining) was available and after seeing the device in person, most of my friends had mixed views about it.  The snapdeal delivery service though was excellent and quicker than expected.
883	Milan	Feb 14, 2015	Yes	Budget phone.	Surprise pack from HTC. Believe me don't think of any other mobile in this price range. Pros- ->NO lag ->Very good camera ->Good display ->Good battery back up Cons- ->Low speaker sound ->No video calling through network ;only through skype or other video calling apps. ->Phone heats while playing game.
