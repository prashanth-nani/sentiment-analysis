Perhaps it may be due to my bsnl plan. Any way, I am satisfied on working of this mobile. I want a flip cover for this particular mobile and enquired in snap deal and other online seller,but the same is not available in intex brand. I have not used 4 G yet. Then the real performance of this 4 G mobile can be assessed. Overally, it is a perfect mobile at reasonable proce.

60	Anik	Feb 04, 2016	Yes	Just awesome	I am really a lazy guy to write feedback and review. Here this time I thought to do the same as I am truly amazed with the quality and price Intex is giving. It is almost a week I am using this mobile and using many application including mobile iron with BYOM. The phone never hangs and also never gets heated with long hours of talk. In 8k this phone gives lot of features and alos gives a very rich feeling in hand One more thing, I would like to mention is that this phone supports OTG. Hence you will be more comfortable in handling files in different devices. At the same time, another five star to Snadeal for a quick and proper delivery. In a  nut shell..... "YES, I would strongly recommend this product."
61	Pankaj Bargoti	Jan 21, 2016	Yes	it is so so only	Something better than nothing
62	fuRkzz	Jan 21, 2016	Yes	awsome moBilE	It is a awsome phone in less price
63	Rahul	Jan 21, 2016	Yes	Phone is nice, service(snapdeal's) is not	I received my product from SD before on the date it showed on the website at the time of ordering.  Phone is pretty nice for it's price, I liked the color. I was basically looking for a phone with 4G and with a 3GB ram at the least market price and I found this one at pretty reasonable price from SD.  I must add extra points to Snapdeal for giving this product at the cheapest price in the market, I compared at all other websites and even at open market and this was the best deal I got.  Camera of the phone is very decent and phone is overall sturdy to hold.  When someone calls, at times, the voice is not very clear, but I yet to validate this and understand if this is a product defect and then chase the manufacturer under replacement warranty.  They gave me an additional second year warranty as I exchanged my old cellphone thru Reglobe, even though their team has taken all details from me, but I have not received any official acknowledgement on this.  Also when I bought this product on their website they advertised an additional offer for this phone with a Promo as INTEXM2 saying "Free Screen Breakage Policy", whereas when trying to browse through the Terms and Condition of this policy, the next page would say "404 not found". It's still there you can check yourself at below link  http://www.snapdeal.com/offers/intex-tnc  I raised complaint regarding this a couple of times and both the times they said, it will be resolved within 48 hours and I'll be able to read this, but it hasn't been fixed till today.  Also the customer care operator told me that this is automatically applied on your phone, when I asked her to explain the offer and provide me information on the terms they had no idea and said team will get back to you, which hasn't happened yet.  So I believe that is why I rate this product low, otherwise no other complaints from the phone, battery is pretty decent.

172	GV	Nov 04, 2015	Yes	Good Product definitely	Neat traditional look.. nice color, iam experiencing a true speed performance in android mobile  for the first time- thanks to 3gb RAM and 16gb ROM. Display with dragon tail glass is good.. for the first 3 full battery charging, its getting late.. i almost charged for 7 hours continuously.. now its so good in charging as well, getting full charge in 3 hours.. (Please use Intex charger only).. Application preloaded are as usual and nothing spl. Experienced good experience in playing Car Game. Why u r loading the demo game with minimum option? thats the only drawback. No use of loading such demo games. Mobile getting heat while playing game.. Pls avoid in future upgradation. Camera 8mp rear and 5mp front- WOW.. truly is so good in pixels and options provided.. Ringtones are normal and usual founf in all androids, should have composed a spl ringtones for INTEX brand.. that would even provide  more speciality and market and guts to Intex users.. pls your research team would consider this (spl Intex branded ringtones).. OVerall iam satisfied and its a Good phone. I give 4 stars and took 1 star becoz of the normal mind set of Intex and not ROCKING and SPARKLING to provide special enthu to the Intex users.. Overall, u can buy this phone.. no technical issues like hangouts, over heating etc.. Thanks - GV, Tamilnadu

175	pravin a	Nov 04, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone in this price range	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
