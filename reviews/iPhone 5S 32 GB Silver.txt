1	Rohit	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	5 star product and 5 star service	Product : No expert reviews here. iPhone is the best you can get in market. Bought it for my wife and she was not that happy with the front and rear camera which I have to admit. None the less, the phone itself is a gem to use. Puts you in premium category between friends.  Service : Snapdeal has always been favorite even if I have bought products from all other site. Best product pricing, i.e. 17805 (ordered from app), exceptional delivery and excellent packaging. Service was icing on the cake for the pride which I feel after buying the product.
2	iphone 5s	Apr 01, 2016	Yes	good service and good product	very good product.good service from snapdeal got a latest iphone  in cheap price . I recommend to buy from snapdeal rather than amazon or flipkart which has higher cost with poor service

18	Sriram	Mar 30, 2016	Yes	As Expected! Gifted my Dad his first iPhone.	Delivery was a bit of a pain. The new courier guy reported that address was incorrect and took the package without even ringing the doorbell. Had to raise a complaint to GoJavas and get the item delivered again.  But having said all that about delivery, the product was up to my expectations.  Packaging was excellent.  Product is 100% genuine.  The exchange offer was good too. (Got rid of my old desktop)

57	SHINDE.	Mar 21, 2016	Yes	No Tile Plz.	It is advised you to check your iphone status with below 2 steps. 1.where to find your iOS device's serial number, IMEI/MEID, CDN, and ICCID-          https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204073 2.enter your serial number, IMEI/MEID, CDN, and ICCID in the link given below & see it's status,warranty&purchase-; https://checkcoverage.apple.com/gb/en/ NOTE:if you find any problem plz use 14 days RETURN POLICY.                                         Technical Problems -as the iphone 5s has metal body it 'll heaten up quickly when we play processor strained action games (like SHADOW FIGHT,ASPHALT 8,CLASH OF TITANS) -iphone has genius sensors like Motion sensor,Ambient Light sensor. They don't work at night so you will feel better with normal phone (8MP+) at night.   Except these two tech problems all other features are BADASS!

So 5 stars to both, iPhone 5S and Snapdeal. Keep up the great customer orientation.

117	Abhijit biswas	Feb 26, 2016	Yes	awesome product	at this price range, apple has made it affordable. Ios platform better any any android. But 16 gb rom and 1 gb ram, may not prove adequate for too much of pics or heavy space occupying games.
118	ankit1420674	Feb 26, 2016	Yes	Excellent Product	Can u tell me without  sim it cant be open the menu
119	kamalsinghr05	Feb 26, 2016	Yes	Excellent Product	very good product..  and very fast delivery by snapdeal..  good packaging..
120	Chandranshu Dwivedi	Feb 26, 2016	Yes	Simplicity Mastered...	Bought this phone for my mother as it's quite simple to use and setting is well arranged. Coming to its features:  1. Camera- I am a power android user so i found the 8MP size of the pics bit disappointing but the clarity and color detailing matches professional cameras. Front cam takes good pics but again in small resolution. Slow motion video is a feature to brag upon.  2. Fingerprint scanner- The feature works butter smooth on the device. Its an apple pioneered feature followed by android phones these days. Its lot easier to open your phone with a touch than entering a password.  3. Build quality and aesthetics- The most important feature of an apple is well taken care of. The phone looks premium and the material used looks of high quality. Build quality is solid.  4. Sound- Compared to my Samsung Galaxy Grand Max and Sony Xperia Z Ultra, the sound quality is at par but the sound volume is significantly high and clear. Its a joy to listen music on iphone's speaker and earphone both.  5. Apps- Most of the essential apps are free on iphone but many are paid. For example apps that utilize the finer print scanner feature are paid. Again, compared to android, this is a negative for iphone. We have already paid the premium for an iphone now we want those apps for free, right?  6. Touch- This technology has been for quite some time in market now so there is not much complain regarding the touch. It's smooth and there were no miss-inputs recorded.   7. Display- Just a single word is enough to define the display, 'BEAUTIFUL'. The colors are vibrant, viewing angles are great. It's a joyful experience to look at your iphone's screen.  8. Battery- Battery will last for a whole one day. Not more than that.  Iphone has mastered the simplicity and thus it is enjoying a different share of market. I have shared all the pros of iphone 5s, the only cons is that its overpriced for what it offers. I still enjoy my android phones and I am not looking for a change. Its upon what your priorities are.

144	Praveen Kumar	Feb 12, 2016	Yes	I received an excellent set of iPhone 5S	May be a comparison of physical appearance of 5S with 6S can be shown so that we know the appearance and size difference. This will help customers to make a easy decision.

270	abhi	Jan 10, 2016	Yes	This is my first android device	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

I got it before the promised delivery date so good work by snap deal on that front. The box was neatly packed with all the accessories in good condition. Yet to use it in full throttle mode. So won't make any over enthusiastic comment. One feedback to snap deal is please increase the refund/exchange policy time period. 7 days is not enough for an electronic device. Flipkart has 30 days so at least make it 15 days or so. Over all satisfied as of now

376	rishirajrathore420	Dec 27, 2015	Yes	Nice mobile	Only one thing that i dont like is battery but new box comes with new chargere or adaptors which have fast charging ability you can nearly fully charge in 1 hour. Other features are just aweseom like camera which is just 8 megapixel back side but can take over many smartphones with 13 mg camera , night photography is alsobvery good ,also front camera does it job well,it is also pocket friendly with 4 inch screen,one of the most important thing buy it from snapdeal because you can get it in nearly 4000-5000 less bucks than those offered in market,i get my iphone in fully new sealed pack condition,i also checked iphone and its accessories and they are 100% original, i have also checked my warranty and its is of full one year,if you want to check your warranty go to apple india website  and open support in that scroll down and select service and support then select service and support coverage then enter your serial number in the space provided on the page which opens, you can check your serial number in settings-general-about phone -scroll down there you will see your serial number. And finally i will tell you you can definately go with this iphone 5s its good in comparison to many other phones in this price segment. Also a great thanks to flipkart team and courier guys to deliver it fast and safely to me and also a original one. thank you SNAPDEAL TEAM !!!!....!!!!.........

The product is genuine (I checked it through iPhone's web site). Packing was good. Only improvement which I would suggest to Snapdeal delivery - please make provision to swipe debit card on delivery. I had to take out cash from ATM to pay to delivery guy. I was also not ready to pay in advance as I am a bit skeptic about pre-payment.  I have been an android user so far and some people told me that Apps availability is an issue with iPhone. Let me assure you all, its not true!!!! I found that all my required free android apps works well in iPhone and are free for iPhone as well. Finger print scanner is a delightful feature and works very well. Also, migrating from android to iOS is quite easy.

I asked my bank they said if we recieved any revert from bank about 12 month EMI they will convert the same Plz  do the needful yrr....

I got a July 2015 manufactured model and not some old piece stored in the warehouse for over a year.   The delivery was as per the mentioned deadlines. Although they can improve there as contenders like Amazon always deliver well before time.  All in all it was a good experience and I didn't face any hassle all through the process.

476	Beast	Oct 21, 2015	Yes	a good phone, but not as convenient as expected	First snapdeal service was great. This was my first purchase from snapdeal as I've shifted away from flipkart and snapdeal didn't disappoint with packaging or delivery. Infact the product was delivered on Sunday. Product was genuine and as per description. I had to pay Rs. 500 to the apple guy to get the system activated. He refused to give bill for that as well. Anyway, not snapdeal's fault.  As per phone Pros- 1. system never hangs, it's so smooth no matter how many apps are open at same time. 2. it's so easy to switch between open apps. 3. body seems sturdy 4. picture quality is great and slow motion video recording is great as well  Cons 1. we don't play games on phone, neither do we see movies or else, still while browsing the handset heats up. 2. keyboard for hindi is poor. some words can't be typed. 3. typing isn't comfortable for me. though for someone with smaller hands it should be fine. 4. button for silent mode isn't convenient. I feel like it's designed to be used in left hand.  Overall a good phone. Pricey, but I expect this product to last longer than other fancy ones.  I personally prefer qwerty keypad phones. This was for my wife.

577	Sumit Jindal	Jul 20, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	Its one of the best phones,The main reason I go with Iphones is camera and software features.  Camera: a larger Æ/2.2 aperture and The pixels are larger too â 1.5 microns, to be exact. All this means more light enters the shutter and it produces better pictures in dark. This is important because a casual user like me takes most of pics in parties, tube light lit rooms, home.. etc..etc.. i think most cameras today in any smartphones are good if you are looking for outdoor photography in bright light. but to be honest I have observed most of the pics I took in past yrs were with frenz in places like eating joints, coffee shops etc.. and in aras like these it matters how much light gets into camera sensors. Megapixels are just numbers, I dont need my pics to be printed on some banner. so 8 MP is good enough for me. Also the true tone flashlight is great in poor light areas.  Software: I believe off lately android has caught up with apple on app ecosystem. so I dont think thats where Ios shines. Its real strength is its integration and control. for eg features like which app can access my location and use background service or use my contacts. I can never control on such granular level in Android. and all these apps drawing data in backgrounds do impact battery even if its minimal. so I simply turn off background refresh on apps I don't need. Android doesn't offer me this feature. Another brilliant example of tight integration and control is updates. I can be rest assured of upda

701	Gurneet singh	May 20, 2015	Yes	Best purchase ever online	Fast delivery and original product
702	Shyam	May 20, 2015	Yes	Perfect Delivery - Perfect Deal	I love you professionalism and the way you deal. But the only problem is when some products are not able at some locations. Even when the customer is in need for that but not available at his location that feels really like pulling us back from the deal. But it would be fine if you make this product available and charge the customer for what you spend for that. This is just an opinion. But is should really say that Snapdeal is the best online shopping site and i always prefer you for my shopping. Thanks and all the best.

If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting.

744	anil	May 14, 2015	Yes	Intelligent Fingerprint reader, Faster, with better camera	This phone looks like the iPhone 5, but goes so much further to get attracted by its owner :)  I've been the fan of Apple, and here is a satisfied customer.  Apple is always on the expensive side when you compare with any other brands, but it is always worth for the money.  At the end of the day you will feel satisfied.   I have used many android phones before, but after switching to Iphone once, never looked back at android again.  The key advantages of iPhone 5s are  here before: the iPhone 'S' conundrum. The new phone comes along, taking the shell of the previous model, adds some new bits and pieces, and then claims to be an entirely new phone.  1.  Very clever fingerprint reader. 2.  Fast (you do not even have to remove/delete the cache files every now and then. 3.  Very handy. 4.  Very good sound quality. 5.  Better camera. 6.  Single sim :) 7.  Good battery backup. 8.  Very nice headphones.  Totally, a masterpiece :)

Its not only the looks but the performance of ios which makes Apple a unique brand. I have used android and windows phone as well but this is an overall AWESOME experience with ios. Each update makes it even better and a total worth for ur investment. So, if you are having a thought then make it a purchase.

Checked for warranty on Apple site for device and was correct. Device came with iOS 8 and had to be upgraded on iOS 8.3 approx 1.7 GB of download. You get approx 26 GB of storage space out of 32GB. Heats up a little bit on low network and battery last for a day with moderate use. Super smooth operations, lag free the best thing to have, headphones provide clarity, cameras just perfect.

790	Rakesh Jaiswal	Apr 30, 2015	Yes	iPhone 5S -- A great product to have	iPhone, the name says it all, it's a class apart, carrying a mobile phone and carrying an iPhone are two different things actually, apple is pioneer of modern day touchscreen mobile phone so, always remember that most of the features which are wildly copied by others are mere copy and this is the original one, the perfect one which you'll feel once you use it.  Now, about the user experience of iPhone 5S as spec is already mentioned everywhere; and how it fares with the products in its league.  "Design & Look" are really rich and perfect, there are other expensive phones in the market but still there is no match of iPhone in terms of design and it looks sexier than the previous ones. You are gonna feel it once you carry it which fits perfectly in your hand, some people might crave for a bigger size but it's still OK. All aluminium and glass chassis gives it a premium look. "Memory", 1GB RAM may seem lesser than some of the heavy spec phones but the way iOS is designed, you may never feel the urge for more memory than this and anyway  a handheld device having 1GB RAM is really capable of satisfying all your operational needs. 16 GB internal momery is good for a normal user, if you need to have a BIG collection of songs/videos/movies then only the other variants would be needed else it's sufficient. "Processor", again the processor spec may seem to be lesser than some of the heavyweights in the market but the way apple manages its resources is awesome so, it's just perfect to give you fast-paced feel as it's a 64-bit smartphone which is still on a 'yet-to-come' list of most of the manufacturers. "Display & Touch", I have not found any better phone in terms of display which apple call as Retina Display, the sharpness is great, the colour reproduction still industry leading. Everything on this phone looks so crisp and amazing that it's an experience in itself to see it. iPhone's feather touch is still the best without any doubt. "Camera", it's a big plus of this phone, it gives you the best possible pictures even in low light condition also burst mode, HD Video recording, take still photos while recording video are too good. "Music", best sound quality has always been the hallmark of apple and this phone is shipped with their exclusive headphone called earpods which I found better in shape and sound than any other earphones, it also has a travel case for earpods which is really handy.  And now the best of the lot, the revolutionary TouchID fingerprint sensor to unlock the screen like other things which is introduced by iPhone and followed by others, we'll see it soon in other phones as well but this is really cool stuff which amazes you each time you use  These days when we pay for "features and feel" of a smartphone, used to change phones quite often and want to flaunt it as these are not just a talking device then spending few thousands more for the premium product is worth every penny. Each of the in-built apps of the iPhone are just phenomenal and given apple always comes with something extraordinary in its releases I think it's wise to go for iPhone 5S if you can pay this much, it's a sheer beauty.  Final verdict: Camera, Look, Display, TouchID makes it a good buy, go for it.
791	SKB	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	I would buy this again.	The item was delivered very promptly and I had no problem in setting it up. I had to go to Apple website for instructions to reset the unit. It is working fine and I am very happy with the unit. Thanks
792	Amarjeet the Quality Lover	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Perfect Product	Yes I got genuine product which I actually expected.The phone is working good. As soon as i got it started, I received update of ios. Apple Id is working properly and I have access to App Store. I have downloaded a number of great apps in this phone since its purchase.
793	drgauravdesai	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	great phone...	I have recently upgraded from i phone 4s to 5s. The phone is absolutely fabulous. With great UI, PIC quality, and music playback. The only observation is that the voice clarity is not sometimes very low and unclear,though with the head phones on it improves.overall a great phone
794	prudhviraj	Apr 28, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	I have got the product in good condition with nice packing with fastest delivery. I would recommend to buy mobiles from snapdeal. Thanks to snapdeal.

802	tandel	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	Good Phone, but...	I liked my first iphone and it fits very good in the hand. I sort of liked everything about it - sound quality, sleekness, smooth finish, clear sound. I even bought a capdase transparent cover for it and it looks just too good. Since i am already an "apple" user (ipad), I didn't have any issues getting accustomed to it. the first thing that impressed me was how easily I could import my contacts from google.  however, I have noticed some battery issues. it gives me around 9-10 hours!!!. It drains faster with 3G when downloading an app. I have the latest software installed and observing it if the drain is faster....I really hope not.
803	Amey	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	Good	Good
804	Mandeep	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	Excellent device.	Received the product in excellent condition. Performance is too good, better than my previous android phone. Touch screen is so awesome. Ready to flaunt the gold apple iphone among my friends.
805	NiTz	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	Perfect !	flawless product..loved it :)
806	Vijay	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	iPhone 5s	I was a big Nokia fan for a number of years...I didn't even want to graduate to Blackberry... Eventually after the near demise of both these brands... I didn't want to get emotional about any brand at all...   However iPhone5S has brought me back to an emotional attachment situation. Absolutely love this device... it scores on all fronts -  look & feel as well as usability,   Cost-wise, it does hurt a little bit. Why does apple need to act nasty there?
807	Dhana	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	Awesome product	wonderful product, best price
808	PINTU KUMAR	Apr 26, 2015	No	Detailed reviews focused on product quality and performance	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.  Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.  By PINTU from KATIHAR BIHAR
809	Ramakant	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	Best phone, good deal...	I don't need to say much about Apple products, they are are always best. I got the best deal on SnapDeal for this phone.
810	Firoz	Apr 26, 2015	Yes	No words for iphone 5s	No doubt about the product iphone 5s all time best.
811	Suresh	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	Awsome	Bought an Apple product for the first time.Worth going in for more of Apple products.Was apprehensive initially but those apprehensions never came true.
812	Virender Singh Rao	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	Perfect smartphone	My review of the iPhone 5s versus the Galaxy s4 (in case any of you are upgrading phones and trying to decide). Side note: Like Coke and Pepsi, there will be folks that are biased toward one or the other, but my hope is to point out some key differences should it help others in their overall decision making process.  iPhone 5s -Better native keyboard – more precise and predictive. More natural feel when typing. The auto correct is great on the 5s. -Siri – Smoother and better voice accuracy. More natural and intuitive. I provide commands ("remind me about the 8am dentist appointment on December 31th") and Siri understands. If I issued the same command on the Galaxy S4, the voice recognition would be confused and misinterpret. -The overall Volume of speaker is louder on the 5s than on the Galaxy S4. I can hear the ringer from other rooms. -In my car and using the speakerphone on the 5s, others tell me the sound quality is night and day compared to the Galaxy S4. When I had my S4 (two different ones), they said I sounded garbled or as if I was talking through a tin can. -I have yet to experience an application crash on the 5s -The Camera is quick to snap shots and pictures are sharp -Availability of iMessage and Facetime. Makes communicating with other Apple users simple. I can see when they are typing a reply back to me, and I can even Facetime in the car or from anywhere without having to download an configure a 3rd party app such as Skype, and then hope the person on the other end had done the same (I have family who are not technology savvy, but easily use Facetime). -The iOS7 operating system is overall more refined and user friendly (i.e. – you can hold down and click X to delete an application on the iPhone rather than get confused trying to find the Settings/Application submenus on the Android/S4) -In my area, better overall signal quality / antenna strength. No dropped calls in the same spots I used my S4.  Galaxy S4 -I like having a 'Back' button (bottom left arrow) -The S4 has a larger screen / more real estate -The S4 camera can lag (would display 'Processing' message for 2-3 seconds while images save). Images were often blurry or not as sharp as I had hoped even after adjusting various settings. -I do like having a removable battery and accessories available with the S4 such as a wireless charger. -I don't like having to close various apps at least daily when they lock up/crash (Android Force Close / Process Stopped Unexpectedly errors). This may be more developer related than phone related, however, this does not happen with my iPhone 5s.  Overall impressions: For me personally, the iPhone 5s is the way to go. Although the perfect phone, for me, would include combining the best features from both, Apple is the clear winner with regards to the features and functionality that matter most to me.
813	DKLFC	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	Perfect. It doesn't get any better	I've got exactly what i wanted...IOS is way better than android...battery is quite well when internet is not in use..specially 3G...on wifi it works smoothly...camera...performance...evrythng is mind blowing...jst...on 3G battery drains...or else...awsm phone..! :D
814	mayur	Apr 25, 2015	Yes	It delivers each and every thing with perfection.	It delivers each and every thing with perfection.Blazing fast processor.Well optimized OS.A great looking phone not only looks but also it excels in performance too Apple is a premium brand which provide premium service at common parlance.Our believe that mobile technology of today is very advance is totally a Myth. 1. OS - its about smoothness and user interference and new feature with latest update . This OS totally upgradeable to the best available OS at that point of time. Unlike Andriod which only 6% devices run on latest OS whereas if you want latest Andriod OS buy new phone which is not in case of apple. Even iphone 4(5 year old phone ) run on latest OS . So you can safely assume this also have same life. 2. Self Life - As state 5 years at least. 3. Apps - As stated above believe that mobile technology of today is very advance is incorrect. Each and every application is need to be made on the very phone for which you are developing it for. Otherwise this will leads to drain of battery, Crashes, Usability of OS and even Software erosion.( this is why BBM not work well on andriod ) . Each phone is different so developers need to develop it for each device which is not possible. This is why apple produce now only 2 a year and apps on your devices crashes. 4. Otherwise apps - Movies and Music are available to download for price which are not too high. Downloading them free is actually illegal. 5. LTE Ready. India will have LTE by September 2014. 6. Security - After blackberry this most secured OS . 7. Screen - though 4 inch but you shall never feel it small . 8. Limited Storage - In order to tackle piracy apple cannot give expandable memory. Those who give they don't have that kind of library of music and Movies. 9. Camera - Best of the rest . All picture look exactly real especially the Sky. Forget MP it is all about zooming . We take picture at close of 2Metre max so why you need more than 8 MP ?? if want to zoom buy standalone camera. Front Camera is heaven for Selfie. 10. Otherwise Hardware- 1 GB and Dual core only ?? if you still think that after reading the review - READ IT AGAIN. OS and apps are optimize as per the Hardware and vice versa thus no issue . Those Quad core and Octa Core phones are no match for iphones as former are simply upgraded to to bridge the Gap of app compatibility issue. 11. Metal body 12. Fringerprint scanner - give it a miss it is still at very initial stage.

831	Sri	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	awesomeness at its peak	Best...!
832	In	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	I would purchase Apple products again.	Apple iPhone 5s is perfect device for me. Easy to carry, touch is perfect, performance is excellent, and of course Apple products are known to last long, provided you are able to protect it from fall or theft. This is my second device, my first device was stolen. Rubber sleeve of charger is not up to the mark and gets easily damaged, also Apple should provide better and soft in-ear headphones.
833	Mani	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Average	delivery time is good but overall experience is average as i upgraded this phone from 4s but not satisfied as much i expcted

838	Kushal	Apr 22, 2015	Yes	Awesome product! Awesome deal!	The product was delivered before time. The packing was perfect, apart from Apple packing, snapdeal had packed adequately to prevent any sort of damage. The product is adequate and to the specified configuration. The best part was that the product wasn't available at Apple Store, yet I was able to procure the desired configuration and at a much cheaper rate. After all the big phones I was looking for something relatively Small yet powerful and that's the product I have received. I have switched from 4 years of android usage to Apple and it seems like it is here to stay.

856	arthi	Apr 20, 2015	Yes	best product with best in class service	After exhausting research, review, many many suggestions and with lots and lots of confusions, I finally ordered my iphone 5s 16gb gold with snapdeal. As the name suggests (snapdeal), its the spot on and reasonable deal with best in class service, when compared with other online dealers, who fakes their offers, with an asterix (condition applies), but snapdeal doesnt in this way. So, the day of truth came and I was still in a dilemma about the product genuity and the way it will be delivered (broken box),even after ordering, but everything vanished just in a sparkle, when snapdeal delivered me the genuine product with a best in class offer and a fully sealed and protected box. Snapdeal customer care executive are well trained with good mannerism, unlike other dealers(both online and shop keepers).  Even Though, Im not a perfect critic to write about apple products. But still, i truly wanted to explain my experience with this classy phone, that is user friendly, compact, good battery, breathtaking camera and ofcourse, not to forget about the sound quality. what about the panel?, i would say a "WOW", hardest ever panel after nokia ,in its earliest period, not to compare thou. Worth for money, with no regrets!!! finally, i found what i want. As they say, if u dont have an iphone, you dont have an iphone ;) Just go for it with no second thought!!!
857	Sunny	Apr 20, 2015	Yes	No one is able to compete wih apple	Best product apple name is enough

861	Prem	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	I phone 5 s 16 GB	VERY GOOD
862	Mohit	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Another amazing product from Apple	I was about to buy iphone 6 but then I searched a little and came to know that iphone 6 is not really a big upgrade to iphone 5s. If you wish to buy iphone 6 better wait for the next variant.  This 32 gig variant is available at a stealing price on SD.  I feel it's better to go for 32 gig iphone 5s instead of iphone 6.
863	Hardeep	Apr 18, 2015	Yes	Amazing experience	Product is in fine condition and original

872	Guest	Apr 17, 2015	Yes	Best smartphone at the best price	Oredered at 11 am got the delivery from snapdeal at 6 pm, same day.  Iphone 5s is the best phone by apple till now. With the excellent touch, one of the best designs, superast processor witH no lags.  Most stylish  and original headohones available in the market, with great sound quality.  I think it is the best smartphone and one should really experience the apple touch, the apple processor, ios, itunes, apple sound quality.  One of the major reasons to buy- neither it slows down nor it hangs.  If you really want a fast processor go for it. Have beeb using iohone 4 since 3 years and it still works like new.

884	raj	Apr 16, 2015	No	awesome Product	Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp  Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)  Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

It doesn't get any better	Its one of the best buying experience I have ever had .My I phone 5s is working just fine ....Snapdeal gives you the best product for the most affordable price .   I was initially reluctant in spending 40 k for Iphone through snapdeal , but Big thanks to Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal who made an effort to personally reply to my query over purchasing.  Snapdeal is the best option than anyother online shopping website. So if you are planning to buy high end phones like Apple than just go ahead . Why to get your phones from retailers for higher rates when you get exactly the same thing for reasonable rates in Snapdeal .

962	Umesh Patekar	Mar 29, 2015	Yes	Smart buy, made the Gudhi Padva sweeter.	Online purchase that too for such a pricey item was a bit scary for one who visits at least 10 shops before buying anything. But the smile this iphone brought on my kid's face, the joy it gave to him was more than worth. Thank you snapdeal for delivering the iphone earlier than we expected. I had to literally wait another full day before opening the pack, as I wanted to welcome New Year Gudhi Padva with iphone. The product came in standard packing, of course great brand  and I am sure I wont need to seek any brand warranty. Probably I would not have bought the iphone 5s at all, unless for the price offered by snapdeal. In fact when I was looking for the iphone intially it never occurred to me to look for online shopping of the same. And the price quoted by Snapdeal created a momentary doubt about the phone quality. But it was only for that moment. I had trust in my mind on Snapdeal and confidence on myself.

1018	Tony John	Mar 01, 2015	Yes	Apple iPhone Rocks	The iPhone 5S is one of the best phones to be launched in 2013, although the screen size seems antiquated now the standard has moved to 5-inches. The 4-inch screen is still good – bright, colourful and responsive. The performance is excellent too. We've not experienced any detrimental slowdown in the year or more we've been using it.   The iPhone 5S's aluminium body that feels premium and solid, yet manages to remain incredibly light. The square edges that looked so cutting edge now look a bit old-school. The rounded corners of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus feel better.   I commute a lot and have no problem holding it for long periods of time. I've even reverted back to reading books on my phone, something I haven't done for years. Would I prefer a bigger screen? Sometimes, but the smaller size of the iPhone makes it extremely pocketable and really easy to use on the go. A good case helps too. While I was initially dubious over Apple's leather one I've grown accustomed to it. It does tend to patina quickly – something I like as I have a bit of a vintage leather fetish, but it won't be to everyone's taste.   Bigger screen phones are just something that need a little getting used to though. It takes just a few days to get to grips with well-designed big phones like the Galaxy Note 4 or 6 Plus. There's a fine line though. We do find the Nexus 6 just that little bit to handle easily.   Certainly you won't notice much of a difference handling the iPhone 6 if you're coming from an iPhone 5S or 5. The 4.7-inch screen isn't that much bigger and it's a lot slimmer than the 5S.

1037	sandyhey	Feb 21, 2015	Yes	Apple is amazing....bad packaging....	Hello all, Its now been a week I am using 5S & its awesome, before buy i did a lot of research and being loyal to android for a long time make me to move away from it. initially i tried windows ph but it lags the apps & i dont like many window like structure on the main screen. Then I came across this beauty called 5S. Actually in many ways it is better than Iphone6.  Thumbs up to snapdeal as i got product delivered on time. But the seller has done worst packaging. They just put the iphone box in the one more big box, no bubble wrap no floated bags to protect iphone from vibrations. When i received it, i was under a shock & felt that this phone will not work looking at the packaging. But my luck & iphone was safe inside.  I tell you ppl if you really want to try something different from android, its time for you to try iOS its brilliant. one star i cut for seller.

1080	srikar	Jan 30, 2015	No	Apple iPhone 5S 16 GB	the new Apple iPhone 5S 16 GB defines progress in many ways. Equipped with a 64-bit architecture chip, a fingerprint identity sensor, a camera that takes your photography skills to the next level and an operating system built specially for 64 bit architecture, Apple iPhone 5S is nothing short of a wonder. You call it a wonder; Apple calls it forward thinking! Place Elegance in your Hands Precision is the word when we think about the design of iPhone 5S. It has classy aluminium housing, the sleek metal and glass work, sapphire crystal in the Home button and more sapphire crystal protecting the iSight camera, which makes it look and feel incredibly thin and lightweight. The stylish silver colour adds panache to the overall design. The iPhone 5S Case while saving the stunning body of your iPhone also complements its looks. It is made from premium, hand-selected leather and since this case is precision-crafted for iPhone 5S, your phone looks slim even with the case on. Quick and Secure With Touch ID, getting access to your iPhone has become faster and easier. All you need to do with this new fingerprint identity sensor is put your finger on the Home button and the iPhone gets unlocked. Moreover, your fingerprint can also approve purchases from iTunes Store and the App Store. Further, Touch ID is 360-degree readable, which means no matter what its orientation, your iPhone reads your fingerprint. It also lets you enrol multiple fingerprints. Great Performance with A7 Chip, iOS 7 and M7 Coprocessor The new A7 chip gives 2x faster CPU and graphics performance as compared to the A6 chip. This chip makes the iPhone 5S the first 64-bit smartphone in the world. Enjoy detailed graphics and complex visual effects that were earlier only possible on Mac computers, PCs and gaming consoles, thanks to OpenGL ES version 3.0. The new M7 coprocessor helps reduce the stress on the A7 chip. Your fitness apps that track physical activity can access motion data from the M7 coprocessor without engaging the A7 chip frequently. M7 can sense when you walk, run or drive. Also, if your phone has not moved for a while, the coprocessor reduces network pinging to help save battery. We all know how iOS 7 has made using iPhone easier and much more fun. But do you know which phone was iOS 7 initially designed for? You guessed it. It was designed with iPhone 5S in mind. It was made keeping in mind the 64-bit A7 chip, the Touch ID fingerprint identity sensor and the new iSight camera. Furthermore, iOS 7 boasts of new features like smarter multitasking, AirDrop and Control Centre. Enjoy ultra-fast wireless as iPhone 5S now supports more networks than ever before. So, download and uploads become faster. Also, iPhone keeps increasing the number of carriers it supports worldwide, helping you take advantage of fast networks in more places. Capture Memories in Style Take amazing photos anytime, anywhere with the powerful iSight camera. The new iSight has a 15 per cent larger sensor, bigger pixels and an aperture of ƒ/2.2. The continuous burst mode lets you capture several shots by snapping 10 photos per second. Further, the real-time analysis advises individual shots or a sequence of photos that you might like best. Auto image stabilisation makes moving objects look less shaky. Other features include slow-motion video, live video zoom, square photos, Panorama photos and photo filters. The new FaceTime HD camera offers larger pixels and an improved backside illumination sensor that gives it increased sensitivity in low light. Hip and App-ening iPhone 5S comes equipped with apps to make your life much easier. It has an app for everything that you have on your agenda. The various apps let you reply to a call with a text message, view all your schedules at a glance, read your mail and much more. Other than the built-in apps, iPhone gives you the choice of several other amazing apps on the App Store. Get iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Keynotes and Numbers apps free from the App Store.

1091	Vinayak	Jan 20, 2015	Yes	The grand phone	The brand says all and the delivery was very fast and was in a very good condition
1092	ben geo	Jan 20, 2015	No	Great Phone with Awesome Built Quality	From a distance, the iPhone 5S looks almost like a replica of the iPhone 5. This is both a good, as well as a bad thing, depending on what you're seeking. If you're happy with the compact form factor of the iPhone 5, then you have a reason to cheer since most high-end flagships come with big screens and often sacrifice ergonomics and usability. However, if you're someone looking for a big display, you're in for repeated disappointment. I feel the display is still the best in its class offering excellent brightness, wide viewing angles, and under-sun legibility. Images and text look crisp and sharp, and if you're happy with the screen size, you don't really have much to complain about.  The Home button, which is the only key on the front, is located just below the display, but sports a silver ring around it. It's one of the few visible changes that you'd see in the iPhone 5S. Its purpose is much more than being a cosmetic enhancement. It is part of the Touch ID fingerprint sensor which is integrated with the Home button and offers an alternative way of securing the phone.  The iPhone 5S is the first widely available smartphone to be powered by a chip that features 64-bit architecture. Apple also claims that its A7 chip delivers CPU and graphics performance up to two times faster than its predecessor. the speed bump is not related to the processor being 64-bit. Though it lays the foundation of the future; the 64-bit architecture will help in better memory management and will work in tandem with apps optimized for it as they're made available. It also supports OpenGL ES 3.0 standard for enhanced graphics performance especially while playing 3D games.  The phone charges really quick, so if you do carry a charger, you can re-energize your iPhone in a jiffy. While Apple already offers a 4 digit passcode lock to protect the iPhone, the Touch ID offers a simple, yet effective way to authenticate the phone for unlocking it, or while purchasing content from the App Store and iTunes Store.  It's worth pointing out that you'll still need to set-up a pass code and verify at at certain times, in addition to verifying the biometric fingerprint.  Up to five impressions of fingers (including thumbs) can be added. This means that you can also add finger impressions of different individuals, in case more than one person uses the phone.  The camera on the iPhone 5S offers a 15% larger sensor, bigger pixels and an f/2.2 aperture to allow more light to come in. The improved optics result in much better low-light pictures compared to the ones shot with an iPhone 5. The level of noise and distortion while capturing lit objects in low-light conditions, is much lower in pictures taken with the iPhone 5S. We also found colour reproduction to be more accurate, and white balance to be in perfect harmony, thanks to the new image signal processor, part of the phone's A7 chip.  Having said that, even if you're not an iOS user but want to invest in a device that will last you more than an year (even two years), receive regular software updates, deliver a consistent camera and stable software experience, and offer a premium yet solid look and feel, then we'd recommend the iPhone 5S.  Other Great Features  1. Slow Motion Camera works Great 2. Hyperlaps video 3. Facetime and iMessage that are free to use. 4. One year india warranty and genuine 5. battery works for 15 hrs approx. I charge my phone twice in 25 hrs as i am hooked on to it a lot with Wifi/3G. 6. Best when used with 3G.  You can go ahead to buy this phone as the prices are less now after iPhone 6 launch. Do like review to help others.
1093	Mandeep kumar Behera	Jan 20, 2015	Yes	That's Good Stuff	I got my iphone within a week from snapdeal. I think it could be faster as i live in mumbai. Otherwise the iphone was safely delivered and the best thing, in snapdeal i got it for the lowest price.

1098	Shail Thakur	Jan 20, 2015	No	Premium and Royal Feel	best looking mobile in market and have a class   The iPhone 5S: a phone that looks like the iPhone 5, but goes so much further under the hood. Is that going to be enough to impress the baying hordes?  We've been here before: the iPhone 'S' conundrum. The new phone comes along, taking the shell of the previous model, adds some new bits and pieces, and then claims to be an entirely new phone.  Which it is, of course. But also it isn't. Well, mostly is. To be sure, it's the kind of move that only Apple can pull off with any kind of conviction: the notion that it can take the same chassis, have a little tinker, throw in a new CPU, slightly better battery and camera, and call it an all-conquering device.  But then again, such is the clamour to know all about it, is that such a bad move? There are literally millions of people the world over who can't wait to see what the next handset from Apple will be, and there was no surprise with the iPhone 5S.  There are a few who question whether it's 'fair' to launch a phone and then append an 'S' to the same thing a year later - Apple's response would likely be that nobody is forcing you to buy the new hardware. And that's a fair point. Yes, this is a phone that bears far too many hallmarks of its predecessor. And yes, this is the third time Apple has done this.

1123	KUNAL	Jan 08, 2015	Yes	Awesome phone... U'll definitely luv it	If you are getting confused whether to go for android or iOS... Then I would recommend u to go for iOS... 5 stars for its user interface... Its very simple, even the people who are new to smartphones will find it easy to operate... Secondly, it will never hang or freeze... Loudspeaker quality is awesome... Camera is beyond comparison... The design is eye catching, compact and durable... Display is unquestionable...  Yet if you want to store HD movies or want to store large files in it then you may have to opt for 32gb or 64gb but if you are a decent user u can go for 16 gb, it will be more than enough... Battery life is average... Fingerprint sensor works flawlessly... Headphones quality is above average... FM radio is absent... Calling quality is very good...

1262	Skynet Technologies	Mar 26, 2014	Yes	It is always good to buy apple products	It was on time and above my expectations. Thank you
1263	Nikhil	Mar 26, 2014	Yes	Best phone money can buy	Its one of the best phones,The main reason I go with Iphones is camera and software features.  Camera: a larger ƒ/2.2 aperture and The pixels are larger too — 1.5 microns, to be exact. All this means more light enters the shutter and it produces better pictures in dark. This is important because a casual user like me takes most of pics in parties, tube light lit rooms, home.. etc..etc.. i think most cameras today in any smartphones are good if you are looking for outdoor photography in bright light. but to be honest I have observed most of the pics I took in past yrs were with frenz in places like eating joints, coffee shops etc.. and in aras like these it matters how much light gets into camera sensors. Megapixels are just numbers, I dont need my pics to be printed on some banner. so 8 MP is good enough for me. Also the true tone flashlight is great in poor light areas.  Software: I believe off lately android has caught up with apple on app ecosystem. so I dont think thats where Ios shines. Its real strength is its integration and control. for eg features like which app can access my location and use background service or use my contacts. I can never control on such granular level in Android. and all these apps drawing data in backgrounds do impact battery even if its minimal. so I simply turn off background refresh on apps I don't need. Android doesn't offer me this feature. Another brilliant example of tight integration and control is updates. I can be rest assured of updates for next 3 Years. I know android does that, but only with nexus devices and that too only for 2 years. Last but not the least. I can at least rest in peace knowing that If god forbid I ever loose my phone, I dont loose my data and most important the person stealing it will not get anything because of i-cloud activation lock.

Iphone 5s gold colour gives it a distinct identification from all other phones n fingerprint security is just what i need the most
1273	Dr.Nihar	Jan 15, 2014	Yes	MOST ADVANCE GADGET..	APPLE D NAME ITSELF DESCRIBES D QUALITY. ITS PERFECT 4M EVERY ASPECT. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION EVERY HUMAN IN MODERN WORLD SHOULD HAV THE I PHONE. I CONSIDER IT  AS AN EXTENSION OF HUMAN BODY. IF UR JUMBLED UP BETWEEN TOO MANY OPTION AND BUDGET IS NOT A PROBLEM DEN GO FOR IT. NO DOUBT COST IS QUITE HIGH BUT ITS WORTH BUYING .   1.D DESIGN IS PRECISE AND EACH PART IS VERY NEATLY CARVED FROM A SINGLE ALUMINIUM BODY.  2.D DISPLAY IS AWESOME U CAN COMPARE IT WITH ANY AVAILABLE DISPLAY OF D WORLD.  3.SOUND QUALITY IS JUST WOW. ITS QUITE MORE BETTER BY PUTTING A HEADSET.  4.TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS UNCOMPARABLE.  5. CAMERA IS VERY GOOD WITH TRUELIGHT FLASH.I M A HOBBYIST PHOTOGRAPHER VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH IT. 6.NEW TECH LIKE FINGER ID DETECTION IS WORKING VERY NYCLY.  7.BATTERY BACK UP IS VERY GOOD.  8.SPECIFICALLY SPACE GREY COLOUR IS ATTRACTIVE. D APPLE LOGO IS QUITE MORE VISIBLE IN WHITE.  9. CELLULAR , 3G AND WIFI NETWORK ARE ITS BEST.  10. U HAV TO BUY SOME IMP APPS THATS THE GREATEST DRAWBACK I THINK OVER ANDROID.  IN MY OPINION IF U ARE A APPLE FAN AND NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT BUDGET DEN GO FOR IT.
