107	SaiKrishna	Feb 21, 2016	Yes	Awesome Phone In This Price	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.

142	Aluk	Feb 05, 2016	Yes	At this price, There's nothing better than this	I'm writing this review after 50 days of use. When you consider the price it's the best android to have. The phone has 8 gb internal storage, out of this 5-6 gb are available. primary cam is good enough (when you know you're not buying a camera phone), flash and front facing cam are not that good for night using. It has 1 gb RAM, compared to others devices at this price it's amazing. Battery performance is just good enough, Not great. Overall It's the phone you should buy at this range.

Bought this phone 2 days before, over all the performance is decent. There no proximity sensor which is a main drawback, because it makes some misbehavior on the touch screen while making calls.At least they could have given a feature of auto screen lock while making and receiving calls, just like what most of the touch screen phone have. I hope Infocus can help us from this problem by making some solution by a phone update, as soon as possible.  Thank You.

443	mohan reddy	Dec 04, 2015	Yes	Awesome Mobile	This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece. Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands. but one thing is disappointed that is ear phones not provided by infocus.

Gaming is satisfactory in this price range. Asphalt Nitro works well without any lag 5. Free Ram is good Enough for smooth performance  Cons 1. Resolution is not upto the mark. But it saves battery.  2. Absence of P- Sensor and L-Sensor. 3. Loud Speaker quality is not good enough. But provides descent performance.

472	Satyam from Eluru	Nov 30, 2015	Yes	Worthy for money and  No service centers for Infocus.	Phone is very nice to handle and touch is very soft. Features are excellent and condition of the app arrangements are nice. I am feeling good as well bad by using this. We can not fine out such a phone for four thousand rupees.  What is the problem is there is no service centers in A.P. as well as Telangana for Infocus, do not buy this products because the customer care of Infocus people are very not responding properly and snap deal not give you service and it does not support Infocus customers. Because they got their money and people who bought product has to suffer. If your device is good condition, its okey, otherwise you havehave to cry alone. No body bother you. Its my experience with snap deal and Infocus.

478	murugan anand	Nov 30, 2015	Yes	my thought about this	infocus m260 8GB is better than other. because the charge level is normal and its RAM is 1GB it is 75 percentage sufficient.
479	ssharma20775	Nov 30, 2015	Yes	Awsome mobile	Since i have used it for one month i am giving my review for this mobile. In simple words it is awsome and perfectly fit for the backbanchers. It combined all the features of a mid range mobile 1gb ram with quad core processor. Its front camera pictures are nice but the back camera doesn't give a better output. It doesn't hang in the daily uses. Its signal strength is very good. The one problem is that i doesn't get any earphones with the packing. And it's very tough to find out a back cover or flip cover for this mobile in the market. And taking the price and performance in my mind i give it 5 star and recommend it.
