32	chinni	Oct 30, 2014	Yes	iBall Andi 4.5K6	This phone is better phone in this price range. 1 GB RAM, 1.3 GB for apps, 1.3 GHz dual core processor.. 4.5" qHD screen. the touch screen is very much responsive and ear valume is not good. The Phone has all the properties as per the specs given on iBall site. It has accelerometer, magnetic sensor, proxymity sensor, ambient light sensor and GPS. The phone has iBall OTA. I use this phone for normal/personal use. When I have opened 4-5 documents I observed a little (1 Second or so) hangover or lag in executing the touch responsive command. I have not used the phone to play games, so i cant say how the phone will behave in its response. Internet speed is also very good no hangups or drop down in internet connectivity.

42	ram	May 12, 2014	Yes	camera veryyyyyyyyyy bad	camera&battery; waste
43	Ravindra	May 12, 2014	Yes	this is very good smart mobile	This is good smart mobile with all good specifications.  Only problem of battery performance. I am not expected as 1600 mah battery this much low performance.   I think iBall need to work on this and get it improve of battery performance. then this model smart mobile will rock on sales.  Other than battery performance, overall is very good with this price range.  My kid is very much liking to play games on this mobile, comparing with Samsung galaxy S dues 2. He is disporting with battery performance.
44	Nusrathullah	May 12, 2014	Yes	iball mobile iam next buy	iball product is very good quality for touch &sound; camera clearity very smooth nice gooooooood.
45	CRD	May 12, 2014	Yes	Value for money	Got more than I bargained for at a very good price. Big screen size, awesome audio output, superb touch screen, multipe pre-loaded apps...all packed in.  The camera is good. Pictures are good. It's only the video quality thats a let-down  Overall, a good buy for me.
46	Ramesh	May 12, 2014	Yes	iball andi 4.5 k6 seems a good smartphon	iball andi 4.5 k6 seems a good smartphone.... but it's camera quality is poor. It has * megapixel camera but dosen't have that much quality. otherwise speed, touch, storage capacity is good. One thing which I like that it has lots of ram free so we can run more apps. I played 3D games like Tank Recon, Frontline Commando 2 not any lag is there.  This is very good smartphone except it's camera.
47	mukesh	May 12, 2014	Yes	excellent product	This mobile is worth the price.I am really satisfied with the product and would buy again if need arises.Please insert 32 GB SD Card for best results. Mukesh Sanghvi
48	chintan	May 12, 2014	Yes	not satisfied	Very low battry life and speker is not functioning good.
49	Madhav	May 12, 2014	Yes	Very good mobile	good phone but playback sound of video recording is poor. at this price I ball andi 4.5 K6 is giving 1GB ram and this is not possible in most of other phones with similar price.
50	Amol	May 12, 2014	Yes	its just a better phone !!	This phone is just a better phone in this price range. before purchasing I was not so confident whether my choice would be a good one because we are used to hear that samsung , HTC, sony or nokia are the only best. But now I am very much satisfied with this phone. 1 GB RAM, 1.3 GB for apps, 1.3 GHz dual core processor.. 4.5" qHD screen. the touch screen is very much responsive. The Phone has all the properties as per the specs given on iBall site. It has accelerometer, magnetic sensor, proxymity sensor, ambient light sensor and GPS. The phone has iBall OTA. I use this phone for normal/personal use. When I have opened 4-5 documents I observed a little (1 Second or so) hangover or lag in executing the touch responsive command. I have not used the phone to play games, so i cant say how the phone will behave in its response. Internet speed is also very good no hangups or drop down in internet connectivity.  I have not observed any issues or malfunctioning. I hope iBall will have their authorised service cnter in pune. I will definitely recommend this phone.
51	Wilson	Feb 03, 2014	Yes	Awesome phone in medium price range!!!	This phone is really awesome. This is the only phone which has 1GB RAM memory which comes in below Rs.10,000 range. But speed is not that appreciable but its ok. 8MP camera captures very clear pictures. Camera and gallery control is good. The screen clarity is so good. Usually it won't be clear in other mobiles which comes in 7000 range. iBall rocks!!!
