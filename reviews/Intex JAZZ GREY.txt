3	Ashish	Jun 13, 2015	Yes	Very good battery life but beware of same fraud merchants.	The phone is very nice to feel,long battery life,loud sound.Bought it on 15 may 2105 but I am not satisfied with the Merchant,they shipped second hand product to me.Seal was teared,phone was not in wrapper,Screen protection was removed,full of scratches,Box was teared from one side,Horrible packing just a polythene covering the box etc. I initiated a return. I warn everybody here that don't buy from merchant "Gemstoneindo".They are selling second hand phones.And one more thing this phone is discontinued 6 months before,but otherwise this is very good phone.

11	shubham	Mar 20, 2014	No	Excellent battery life	positive points:- Excellent battery life Solid external memory Economically priced Standard display...!!!... negative points:- Poor camera Average in-built storage...!!!... Intex Jazz is a feature phone with a decent display size, holding most good options still low-priced. The phone provides a brilliant talk time. This phone can be a good choice for people who travel a lot and it can act as a good substitute for your smartphone...!!!...
