8	Sudeshna Kundu	Sep 19, 2015	Yes	Intex Aqua Mini Style	Phone is perfect in all senses,on wifi it asks for software upgradation, which other manufacturers like karboon , micromax failed to comply with, the freebies, back case and screen protectors are not of good quality, and these are not available in the market, only cons side : bundled with some trial games and bloatwares, which one can not uninstall during warranty period(one has to jailbreak)
