1	Ashok Dixit	Apr 27, 2015	Yes	Great phone at the price range	if you want to purchase an entry level phone intex power offers you all the features at a price range of 1000 To 1200 Bucks. It is not only a basic phone but also comes loaded with multimedia features vga camera mp3 player and bluetooth features which you will not find in any basic mobile at this price. The battery performance is very good and lasts almost for 2-3 Days with average use. Overall this is a very good deal if u want to buy a cheap basic phone..
