4	girijesh	Sep 22, 2015	Yes	NOT A BETTER SMART PHONE DUE TO POOR BAT	ros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion) Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone . LIKE SONY SAMSUNG.
