Camera will gave you a sharper image then a 13 megapixel camera of an other phone .The pinch time and zoom time is fast .just in a secnd you can zoom in and zoom out that to without hanging. Software quality is good in comparison with 4s.In 5c there are 200 new features that will make it perfect. Best phone to buy.

216	Awadhesh Jha	Apr 19, 2015	Yes	Average, Ordinary	It's cool phone, good processing with latest iOS. The cons are: Low memory space. There is total 8 gb space, and almost 6 gb are already filled up by applications. So if you looking for a good internal memory phone, go fo other versions. Also, I updated this phone to ios 8.3 and whatsapp is not working now :-D  So, in conclusion, I would like to say, go for other phones in this price range, you will be benefited. I just have purchased for software testing purpose.  All the best!

257	Prakash Pandey	Mar 01, 2015	Yes	Apple - the perfectionist	I have been using snapdeal for past many years. Till today it has never disappointed me.  An android phone tends to slow down after a considerable period of time but Apple never slows down. I even have a 5 years old Iphone 3GS which was the sole reason why I rely on Apple so much.Apple products are durable and a long lasting product unlike Android phone.  The phone has a very good camera and a long lasting battery life.  If 5Gb capacity is not a problem for you and you need a stylish phone with almost every quality of a good smart phone then go for IPHONE 5C 8GB

Good Job Snapdeal !!!!!  This is my first apple phone and I had a thrill using it.I have no words to describe how it feels.   I was always fascinated for iPhone but I was using Samsung as iPhones are overpriced, but finally my obsession outweighed my pocket and i bought this device.  Pros: Amazing Camera, Never Hangs, Perfect Touch, Clear and Crisp display,Impressive Polycarbonate build   Cons: Battery backup with 3G (Requires charging every day)   Finally, I really stand by "If u Don't Have an iPhone. Well. You don't have an iPhone".

I Got delivered iphone on time and the product is fully packed, I was very happy to open the pack and I'm 100 % satisfied with the product (iphone )delivered by snap deal because the iphone looks brand new without any scratches or damage. The pack contains charger,usb cable, ear phone and other iphone help information with website details about online support.  Initially when i researched with direct Istore and other apple dealser they commented only if we buy in direct dealer or istore we can avail the warrenty and full free support and service benfits from the iphone service centers. Later i confirmed with iphone apple customer care team (-launced in india) . They provided me full and complete information and recommended me saying getting the iphone online or direct store for both cases the warranty applies for the iphone.  Thanks once again snap deal and apple customer care team.

The delivery on behalf of Snapdeal was also prompt and I got the authentic product at the best price on Snapdeal. Overall, a great buy to enjoy the smooth and crisp IOS experience!

Have not tried any games but about 8 hours of wifi can easily be handled by the phone without getting discharged another 10 hours.   Sound quality and Camera is very good Camera has retina display and a flash which makes it even better than the 4S camera  5C in particular is not as expensive as a 5S or a 6S making it much more affordable at the same time a fast smartphone that does not hang

389	Chakshu	Oct 02, 2014	Yes	Worth each penny	Very nice phone at this price range. Works awesome with iOS 7, no issues whatsoever. However i am not sure about iOS 8, will wait sometime for online reviews and one thing for sure once updated there is no going back and it will make this otherwise fast phone slow and sluggish. Camera, battery life, display, every thing about iphone 5c is great and IMO this phone will do great for a year or 2. Polycarbonate back is not that bad but i do miss metal glass  back of my iphone 4s (which became quite useless after ios 7 update last year). Games like subway surfer, temple run is great as expected but i have not tried any of heavy gameslike Fifa or asphalt
390	Dinu	Oct 02, 2014	Yes	good one.	Awesome.

393	iphone developer	Sep 22, 2014	Yes	Good phone; quick delivery	Was looking for a device which has latest iOS and can be updated to iOS8 as well. Perfect match between price, features and upgradable.  Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp.  I was using iPhone 3GS for a long time and best thing about Apple is that they provide updated OS for their devices which is missing with Android phones. Hardware is really good and its screen / touch remains same even after years of use.
394	Goms	Sep 22, 2014	Yes	the best	superb phone that too apple for an affordable price

This is an extreme machine that has nothing special but love. The perfect engineering of the device gives you a complete satisfaction of owning a perfect mobile. That's iPhone.

408	Nawed Akhter	Sep 13, 2014	Yes	One word: Satisfied	In this price range, iPhone 5c one of the best smartphones out there. If you are a first timer in using any smartphone; avoid this phone cause the majority uses android and that means you won't be able send stuff via Bluetooth ,etc. At any rate, If you want an iPhone experience, you should definitely get this one.
409	Pritam	Sep 13, 2014	Yes	Apple rules once again	I am confuse before buying this iphone as its not a metal iphone which are famous for beautiful metal & eye catching desgin but when i hold this phone into my hand its feels superb . No one can beat this phone in the nonmetals category  It a not a cheap plastic as other mobile company used its a one piece polycarbonate piece crafted beautifully.  So go for it without any hesitataion.At last i am very thankful to snapdeal to provide such a excellent iphone at best price

420	Samarth	Sep 05, 2014	Yes	Best at its segment	I am a Apple Fan. I love this phone the built quality is amazing it feels like it is made of high quality ceramics even thought it is plastic thanks to its glossy finish and it's steel reinforcement. The display is amazing with 326PPI which is also a true SRGB certified display. The performance from the dual core A6 chip and 1GB if RAM is amazing thanks to Apple's skills to make the most efficient devices. Camera is amazing, it is not as good as the S5 or iPhone 5s but still it has a brilliant camera system with sapphire lens to avoid scratches. Last but not the least it has access to the App Store which is loved by developers all over the world and it is the first ecosystem to get apps. To wrap it up iPhone 5c has the best built quality, performance, display camera and the best ecosystem at its segment which makes it the best allround phone at its class.
