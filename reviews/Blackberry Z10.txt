12	Himadri Bhushan	Dec 19, 2014	Yes	Amazing Phone	The name Blackberry it self is an legend and the all new Blackberry Z10 the full touch screen phone launched by blackberry is an superb phone and with great camera and touch and with internal memory running speed With 2gb ram it's just goes super always and it is a trusted brand Blackberry thought it is not so popular now a days but just think once why blackberry is taking more money than others or Blackberry don't want to sell its product or it don't want to compete in market and to gain profit it's not true it has many business facilities for which blackberry is the legend simply cool phone but it's battery backup is cool but not that much but can be used for a long day.

14	mohan	Dec 19, 2014	Yes	Worst experience with Snapdeal and BB	this phone hangs a lot even more than a lot, more than 20 times a day and every time you have to take the battery off and restart again. Even takes a lot of time at start up. The bill that i received with this phone doesn't contain the IMEI no. or any no. which proves that the bill belongs to this phone. I'll suggest not to buy phone online.

29	Ashutosh	Aug 01, 2014	Yes	worst phone	This mobile gave me the worst phone experience I've ever got in my life. *head phone doesn't work *charger port doesn't work *hangs a lot *Most of the time mobile network disconnected(Not fault of mobile network)  I seriously recommend to not to purchase this dumb box
30	Kevin	Aug 01, 2014	Yes	BB z10 best mobile for decent price	This mobile is known for its stunning style and multi platform support. First I want to say about the product which I got from snap deal, when I received this mobile it's nicely packed and sealed one. I was stunned to see the look of this phone and it's user friendly. This phone is not like other BlackBerry mobiles it's best among the other. it support 95 percent of android application. I got this with manufacturer warranty and decent price, it really worth your money. I always rate best for best phone with decent price and this is one among that. BlackBerry touts its web browser as faster than competitors, and it sure looks like it. The loading speed extends beyond just websites though â€” many apps and even email messages also open faster than on other phones. it's speed good even in 2g and best in 3g. There's a removable battery, in case it goes belly up, as well as an SD card slot to add to the 16 gigabytes of included storage. I use 64 gb SD card feel like holding my world. inside It also has a micro HDMI slot for connecting to a TV or monitor, so no extra adapters are required to pipe video from the phone. The 4.2-inch screen also boasts 356 pixels per inch, which is sharper than many competing devices on the market.login to your accounts, from email and Facebook to Twitter and LinkedIn, text messages, notifications and BBM pings, are found in one location, which can be accessed by swiping in from the left of the phone.The drawbacks is BlackBerry world does not has enough applications and games compare to google play, it has only few free apps that too not good apps. BlackBerry should really work in it to improve their business in this competition mobile world :-)
31	Rikky	Jun 11, 2014	Yes	Awsome Phone, just a world in this price	Awsm phone in this price , nothing can beat this
32	Vicky Shah	Jun 11, 2014	No	Awsome Phone - Much better than Android	Very Polished Operation System and Apps. Must buy, Highly recommended. Loudspeaker is Awesome for conference and watching video's. Very slim Light n Sexy. Even GPS Free - Map my India is awesome for trips.
33	Sumit Jindal	Jun 11, 2014	Yes	BEST SMARTPHONE	This is the best Phone which can augment your communication experiences and productivity level which other gimmick devices from Samsung or Apple/iPhone can do. But our choices are made by media and media has been very harsh on Blackberry. But you ask any person who has been using the New Blackberry 10 devices (z10/Q10/Q5) their response will mostly positive and of great experiences. But I feel sorry for the fact that inspite of being one of the best Devices available in the market, this company is going through such a rough weather.
34	Tabib	Jun 11, 2014	Yes	Blackberry z10	The mobile is perfect with amazing looks but the handset which I received was facing sound problem there was no sound. But I can say it with 100% surety that this is the best mobile with this price in the market simply a classic piece.
35	Vikas Guleria	Jun 11, 2014	Yes	Great Look	Product is good. But problem is camera quality little bit poor
36	Mohan Chandra	Jun 11, 2014	Yes	Best Phone with a best offer	Very Good Product offered at a very low price. Very Good Phone. It is special bcoz of its unique features.

41	nightfiremontu	Mar 04, 2014	Yes	best in its class	Very good product. And I said thanks to snapdeal that gives in best price.
42	ripe	Mar 04, 2014	Yes	Exceeded my Expectation	I was a bit wary about buying this phone after seeing and hearing some bad reviews on websites and from shops. But then I liked the design and went ahead with my purchase. I was using an Iphone 4.  BB only comes close to Iphone not at par. I did not go for an I5 since I was bored with the Iphone after using for 2 odd years. Initially I found the battery draining fast as was seen as the biggest problem in reviews. But then I happened to get an update from BB which I feel solved the problem. Of course using 3g/bluetooth even on my Iphone used to drain battery much faster. That is a known issue for all phones.  But BB Maps does not work in India and there is no Google Maps for BB. Incoming calls does not detect contacts in your phone if you have not saved the contact with the country code which I feel is a bit cheap, because Iphone did not have such an issue and now I have to edit them manually one by one. Also limited apps in BB world unlike Apple Appstore. Also cannot charge the phone in the car with the provided USB cable unlike the Samsung or Iphone.
43	jagtar brar	Mar 04, 2014	Yes	best blackberry phone	Gps system doesn't work at all. Rest it's very good. It also lack some applications like bank applications,some games Airtel service.
44	Mk	Mar 04, 2014	Yes	worst	worst battery and no email PUSH technology
45	RaviK	Mar 04, 2014	Yes	Great Phone	:) It makes you smile... BB has done awesome Job.. Use it to experience it..   CON: its outer case should be made more robust..
