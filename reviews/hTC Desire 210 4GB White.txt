48	thiravidamani	Nov 05, 2014	Yes	pls don't buy	I have an htc explorer,  I became a fan of HTC phones after using that for the last 3 years. so i desided to buy this phone.  I read bad reviews about this phone but i dont consider about the reviews.  after i purchased this phone i cant beleve it had a 1ghz processor. my old mobile hsa a 600mhz processor but it does not hang on my normal use but desire 210 hangs a lot, and its camera clarity looks like vga camera. its display also worst when it display a black colour that colour looks like a negative picture. I did not expect this from HTC.  cons:      1:display      2:camera both secondary and primary.       3:phone is hanging a lot(while messaging time also)      4:touch screen not response      5:Very poor battery backup (charge it twice a day with out media and internet use)      6:Its 512mb ram always shows full   pros:      1:good duel sim mobile(but it useless because of its battery)
