5	Excellent	Jan 25, 2016	Yes	Average mobile but cost is high for this	I brought this mobile first 10days the gionee e3 give battery excellent and features also very good. Gaming also good clear and calrity.But after 10 days the following problem is standy battery backup is poor. If we play game automatical hang and have to wait for minimum 5mins and then working, automactically screen light timeout not working we have press off button then its off. And front camera quality is medium, internal memory is waste upto 16gb because we can only use 1.8GB and remaining GB is waste.

8	akki	Jan 25, 2016	No	beast of the hardwares	Gionee i never thought would be that much good. I was using galaxy grand a scrap piece from samsung, got feb up of it and after 1 year of torture sold it for 10K.. then bought this one.. grand was not able to run any heavy weight app like asphalt,temple run and candy crush saga even.. god. when i got this gionee e3 i was amazed with screen quality ips 4.7, very crisp and clear. it runs more than 30 aps at a time without handing. the sound could be better and the battery backup should be more.  one more thing gionee should give some os upgrades also..  i am happy with it..
9	Rahul	Jan 25, 2016	No	Awesome phone............	Gionee, one of the lesser-known brands in India. It gives an HD AMOLED and is a good value for the price and build quality.E3 is well designed from all aspects. With a rubberised matte finished exterior, the E3 has a very strong and rugged frame. All the hardware is enclosed well within the 7.9 mm chassis. The dark front panel has a 4.7-inch display with a front-facing camera and three capacitive backlit buttons for Menu, Home and Back. The power and volume buttons are placed on the right side while the micro USB interface and the earphone jack is placed on the top.The handset is a dual-SIM Android smartphone with support for GSM and WCDMA. One Sim slot is micro and another is mini.E3 features a quad-core Cortex A7 processor clocked at 1.2GHz with 1GB of RAM. The graphics processor used here is the PowerVR SGX544. The internal storage is a good 16GB.display on this one is a 4.5-inch HD IPS AMOLED panel with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The rear camera is 8MP with an LED flash and the front camera is 2MP. Connectivity options include the standard 3G, Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth Gionee E3 is a good looking smartphone. The slim form factor with a vibrant display and fluid user interface does make the E3 worth the price. In terms of looks and performance, the Gionee E3 is definitely recommended. The bundled protective case, the earphones, free screen protector, good looks, excellent slim build, good performance, above average camera and the crisp display are some of the highlights.
